0	an obvious b - grade effort to cash in on the hostel / saw buzz , my expectations for this film were low ( really low ! ) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level . the acting is so bad it 's not even funny , the plot - line is non - existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it ! i 'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating . i can only suspect that 33 of these are cast and crew . the 34th is possibly the directors mother ? - although i 'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2 ! dvd extras include an hour long " making of " feature . which raises the question , " why ? " ( although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do ! ) . avoid at all costs .

5	this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ?  especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president .  yup , you're talkin' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot .  for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine .  the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy .   ( they did in mine , heaven help us . )  for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome .  the tone is terrible and the banter is worse .  forget wit-- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie .   ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? )  sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men's march .  the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time .  judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ?  even the dialogue gets drowned out .  what a waste .

16	an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch' .  two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them .  and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch .  welcome to `ready to rumble' .  judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing .  ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society .  mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny .  unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired .  `ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . .  which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy .  but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome' .  gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics .  by day , they transport raw sewage .  by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community .  with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand .  but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans .  sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans .  gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! '  they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt .  along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well .  you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies .  i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful .  `rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation .  the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience .  luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action .  director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work .  but the violence is too excessive .  having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match .  this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of .  outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on .  the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 .  casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck .  oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ?  he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose .  rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others ) .  wcw fans are sure to appreciate these .  others . . .  well , won't .  i found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . .  ahhh . . . .  `praise' for the film : in `ready to rumble' , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette's `at&t' television commercials .  now there's a low blow for you .

20	this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future in-laws .  the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible .  williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star .  they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode .  williams is excellent as should be no surprise .  gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles .  the real star is lane .  his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious .  perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it .  luckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception .  the question of stereotypes is a touchy one .  these guys personify the homophobic gay image .  you can almost hear the swishing .  if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you'll be outraged .  but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you'll love it .  your choice .

24	ahh yes .  the teenage romance .  an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .  and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .  along now comes `down to you' .  the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .  only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above .  it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to .  this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .  in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .  they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies .  from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .  the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . .  well , only happen in the movies .  fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal .  freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around .  zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue .  rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) .  even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' .  maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .  as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely .  perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny .  the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .  the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .  even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course .  the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .  when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired .  in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity .  `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing .  no such luck with `down to you' .  it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .  and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .  only in the movies' .

30	the question isn't why has grease been reissued .  the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .  no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?  the answer is not an easy one .  grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .  the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited .  travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening .  but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground .  it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .  what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history .  ok , let's not be a spoilsport .  grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .  it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .  he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .  cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .  between grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .  two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .  today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .  today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .  secondly , a lack of talent .  performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .  most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .  a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .  he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .  so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .  if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .  perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .  at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .  so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .  let grease be the word that sparks this revival .

37	warren beatty , diane keaton , goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom's version of the classic romantic , screwball comedy in " town & country . "  the drawing room farce of the 30's dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action .  back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see " the philadelphia story " for a great farce .   " town & country " has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels .  but , there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is " t&c's " downfall .  there is , obviously , a great deal of hollywood talent , in front of and behind the camera , involved in " town & country , " but , without a likable or , at least , interesting story to carry through their efforts , it is all for naught .  and , that's what we get here - naught .  porter stoddard ( beatty ) is a high-powered new york architect with a very good life indeed .  his 25-year marriage to ellie ( diane keaton ) appears , on the surface , to be perfect .  but , there are cracks just below this pristine surface .  his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts , his kids don't need him and his best friends , griffin ( garry shandling ) and mona ( goldie hawn ) , are in the midst of a divorce .  porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper .  at the 90-minute mark of " town & country " i asked myself , " what's the point ? "  i wasn't entertained , i laughed three times - over silly little pratfalls - and spent most of the film marking time 'til the end .  warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog , making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head .  keaton's ellie is an empty headed flake who can't see the obvious as porter screws around on her .  and , as you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ?  the supporting cast is given nothing to do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use .  nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling .  the actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air-headed musician and the character doesn't belong , anyway .  jenna elfman is a sweet , but smart , ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures .  andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress ( is there any other kind in this movie ? )  who comes on to porter .  the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf's by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowell's very strange parents .  glib rationalization of infidelity , like , " if he doesn't speak english , it doesn't count , " are a staple for the screenplay .  the morality of the film seems to be , if you can get away with it , go for it .  the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn't want to know , never mind befriend .  the actors do their best , but are hamstrung by the weak material .  helmer chelsom , who made the outstanding , offbeat comedy " funny bones , " is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on " town & country . "  the production values are high , as one expects from a big budget hollywood film .  but , the opulent sets by caroline hanania , lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and top-notch photography by william fraker cannot save " town & country . "  the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better , for me anyway , if hollywood just said no to this movie .  i give it a d .

40	an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .  the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .  instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .  upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days .  of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .  in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .  rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .  i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .  but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .  ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .  throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character .  the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .  director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .  the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .  the reason ?  mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .  the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .  unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone .  rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .  it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .  several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .  early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .  after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .  it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .  but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .  the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .  or if our passports weren't missing .

45	what if one of our cities became the target for terror ?  what can we do ?  what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ?  what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ?  so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world .  it is the land of opportunities .  it is the land of freedom .  but what if it became the new target ?  this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality .  when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice .  the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : " release him . "  then all hell breaks loose in new york .  a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .  a broadway theater is bombed .  hostages are taken at a school .  as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .  devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .  his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !  f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies .  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal .  but the attacks escalate .  the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .  the land is under siege .  they have lost control . . a  terror is coming from within . .  what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .  it reflects reality .  and that's why it makes such an impact .  edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .  and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .  he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .  he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the " greater good . "  in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .  was that what the terror !  ists really wanted ?  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially .  but to me these protests seem unnecessary .  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced .  agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american .  and it is quite often you hear lines such as " my first boyfriend was palestinian .  they seduce you with their suffering " or " they love this country as much as we do . "  but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority .  more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military .  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !  way .  denzel washington is dashing as always .  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .  bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .  the film is elegantly shaped .  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism .  he tightens the intensity as the events progress .  and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .  it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .  it has courage enough to get involved in politics .  it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .  but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of .   " this is the u . s . army .  it's a broadsword , not a scalpel .  believe me , you do not want us in an american city " - gen . william devereaux , " the siege "

48	... and how they bore you right out of your mind ! the crater lake monster is one of the classic bad films from the 70 's made with no actors of any note , an embarrassing script , woeful direction , and a tireless desire to fuse " horror " with light comedy . this movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath crater lake ... a meteor falls from the sky , and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding crater lake . the whole matter is taken care of by steve our local sheriff . much of the film - when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining - is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named arnie and mitch who run a boat rental place . they try so bad to be funny , that we get lines like , looking at a business sign , mitch saying to arnie " you spelled bait wrong , it 's spelled b - a - t - e. " the laughs were rather scarce here . we then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur . laurel and hardy watch out ! the dinosaur looks fake , but the movie is fun in a bad way . and at the very least , the lake is beautiful .
49	capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight .  gibson's script only adds insult to injury .  johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie .  i say " awesomely " because it's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged .  keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an " information courier " who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head .  he is given " one last job " ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal .  one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it's only followed up on in a token fashion .  for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers .  what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there's no room in this movie for any of that .  the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly .   ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped .  but that's another essay . )  anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark .  why newark ?  maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that's why .  there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) .  the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture .  it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn't kill him .  handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity .  the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind .  everything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace .  snore .  the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un-technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like .  a hacker of johnny's caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that's not cinematic .  whatever .  what went wrong with this movie ?  gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn't work in a movie .  his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn't advance , it convulses .  from the script on out , it was probably all downhill .  renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there's no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?

54	i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto rican . when i heard it was rosie perez , i wondered .. could she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto rican . as far as i knew .... she was a nuyorican . well anyway , i anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch . i realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right . rosie perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto rican . this " documentary " is more a 1st hand , very very personal account on what it is like to be a nuyorican .. and all of what that entails . she ( like most of the nuyoricans i know ) have a watered down , partial and sometimes twisted sense of history . ( how could they not .. they live here . ) yes , all of them are proud . as they should be ! but a lot do n't know the ins and outs of the real culture , history and political background or language for the most part . it all became very very apparent with her participation in the vieques issue . regardless of my personal take is on this issue .. at least i know what the hell the fight is for . there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about .. and only participated in because it was a " puerto rican cause " i really do n't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it . for those of you that are not puerto rican , please view this as a partial account of a woman 's journey of self discovery and acceptance . do not take this as gospel ... a lot of it is n't even true . please consider the source . rosie is an actress ; not a historian . this movie is not and should never be , for other nuyoricans , the base for their information . instead , just a step towards finding more info , learning and debating what the reality is . not just the one coming from this woman 's eyes .

57	i saw this movie sunday afternoon . i absolutely loved this movie . i loved everything about it , from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer ( lila ) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love . i loved these moments because they were just so real . at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby , which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it . but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different . you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time . trust me when i say go see it !

62	i 'm not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half , but i 'm afraid i just could n't stand another minute . if this abject excuse for a film does n't have the late , great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave , then i doubt anything will . the excellent review above ' not a film for parsons fans ' sums up most of my feelings . how dare a ( second rate ) director and writer attempt something to which they 're so clearly incapable of delivering . what were they thinking ? where to start ? the script : i thought i 'd be getting a slice of bittersweet americana . what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no cliché left unturned . stupid hippy ? check . stupid fat cop ? check . awful plot contrivances ? check . embarrassingly written female characters ? double check . total disregard for the story which you 're trying to portray ? check . after a while , you realize that what you 're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that . scene with knoxville . scene with ex girlfriend . scene with knoxville which has n't moved on much . scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one . and so on ... the direction : my friends and i decided , after some consideration , that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy , or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard . that 's how bad the direction was . terrible jump cuts , awful camera work , clunky ins and outs to scenes . god , it was cringeworthy . and then i discovered the director was an irishman who 's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called monarch of the glen ( trust me , it 's lowest common denominator tv ) . and then it all made sense ... the acting : are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go , if he 's not so bad , he stinks , we applaud his efforts ? knoxville just about manages to get through every scene . poor christina a. has no such luck . her performance is a car crash ( though what you do with those lines , i do n't know ) . the ' hippy ' in the hearse : oh dear , oh dear , oh dear . have we not moved on since cheech and chong ? i could go on , but i think you get my drift . what i would say is that , as other reviews have mentioned , no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the byrds , the flying burrito brothers or gram 's solo work . they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology . this film was shallow , failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to ... oh wait , i did n't quite make the end . and i suggest you stay away too .

69	a movie that's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , " the film of the decade ! "  and " a breakthrough ! "  can only be leading up to letdown .  that's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you're going in for the ride of your life , that you'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , " eh . . .   * that's * what all the fuss was about ? "  so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment .  and i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it .  let me tell you , that is an impossibilty .  the truman show is truly " the film of the decade " and " a breakthrough " and more .  and you will come out changed on the other side .  such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it .  jim carrey shows that he doesn't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood's leading men .  the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the " truman show's " run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly .  with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit .  and the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the " real " truman show is clever and well-done .  people , rejoice !  this is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years .  not since " schindler's list " has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well .  this is a classic in the making , and ( to borrow a line from esquire's review ) it stars jim carrey .  nothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word .  for , as i said , this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre .  forget special-effect ladden summer fodder .  drop your romantic comedies in the trash .  toss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile .  you need nothing more than " the truman show " to carry you through the summer , or for that matter , the year .  oh ! and in case i don't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight .

73	overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel " the haunting of hill house " ) stars lili taylor as one of three " lab rats " that participate in a supposed " insomnia " study being initiated by liam neeson .  he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it .  he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of " creepy " cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience .  i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ?  the original was a great psychological horror film .  this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary .  in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary .  unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles .  i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed .  it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly .  owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability .  catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs .  liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do .  finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her .  apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed .  that's too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative .  this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) .  when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ?  robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that .  one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset .  if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying .  what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything .  apparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it's original title .  i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont's version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

74	more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
75	i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze .  i liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) .  i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash .  wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen .  it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards .  criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic .  wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies .  i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal .  i imagine that this shows .  it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known .  i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here .  i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida .  in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges .  all of this happens fairly early in the film .  and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted .  i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked .  wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks .  i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers .  i'd give the preview four stars .  it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since .  over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong .  the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets .  but i'm not here to talk about the preview .  i'm here to talk about denise richards .  now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can .  of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and  flawless body . . . but  i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) .  no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film .  this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future .  the other actors are good , too .  dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) .  bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer .  neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex .  for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived .  that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film .  each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist .  there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful .  i loved it .  
76	just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
77	be warned . .  brit love story in the offing .  effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite .  he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making .  the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school .  they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas .  in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music .  karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company .  chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about .  if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo . . . , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat .  kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much . . .  a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy .  personally , give me those cheap laughs any day .  i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story .  different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it .  by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself .  lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple .  but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like .  prentice does though , and that's never explained .  but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up .  if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either .  snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance .  misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance .  the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment .  kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition ) .  and best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion .  awwww .  terrific closure .  happy ending .  but just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ?  if you figure that one out , let me know .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
78	i figured that it 's about time i let this one out . pokémon fans are suffering in america these days . why ? because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . as far as the series goes , they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television . so what is their problem when it comes to the movies ? honestly now , i have seen all three pokémon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one . they are excellent movies . they are all enjoyable and fun to watch . and , after seeing pokémon 2000 in theaters , i ca n't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts . the way it appears , it seems that they read and see something that says ` insert empty moral here ' in big bold faced letters . it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb ( extreme sarcasm there ) and created this crap . * possible spoilers from here on * well , i guess i should first talk about pikachu 's rescue adventure . my first gripe with this came with no narration . i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokédex narration that plagued pikachu 's vacation , and , instead of going with a caring , gentle woman 's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai , they just cut the narration all together . this would n't have been a problem , except for one thing . did anyone really understand why the exeggcute did n't let togepi go until the end ? possibly the fans , but i 'm sure not the parents . then , there 's the theme song . i could n't help but roll my eyes at this one . the japanese theme song was ` tankentai wo tsukurou ' and was sung by japanese children . it was fun and enjoyable . this one : nauseating . now , one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana . nice music , fun to watch . that 's changed with the bellossom . the music sucked for one , but on top of that , they had all the pokémon talk during the music , which turned out to be jumpy , annoying , and just unnecessary . oh , and then there 's the poliwhirl who thinks he 's a poliwrath . you 'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . basically , not much could save this little ill fated dub , which is very unfortunate considering its potential . but , i have n't touched on the worst of it yet . you 'd think that the warning signs would 've been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power . for some unfathomable reason , i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb . my thoughts were ` well , they screwed up on the first movie , but the second is different as far as the theme goes , so they should do well . ' that in mind , i just did n't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said , ` you will believe that one person can make all the difference . ' with the way they said that at every turn , i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version . then comes nintendo power , in which i see all my fears realized in the words ` the main feature ' the power of one . ' at that point , i became a bit more uneasy . ` the power of one ? ! ' not a good sign . however , i still kept some of my false faith . big mistake . sitting in the theater , i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . i can see a point in that since they did n't pander this thing , repeating it over and over like in msb . however , it did more damage than anything else in this movie . first of all , the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read ` the world turns to ash . ' ah hah . so , ash is the chosen one ? whatever . in the japanese version , the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . this time , he 's the chosen one . a greater way that this did damage was to lugia . lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokémon movie .... when the movie was about lugia . in this one , lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash . in the scene where they 're flying back to the main island , lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia 's existence , not that ash is going to make all the difference . overall in this category , ash was n't really the ` one person ' that would make the difference , since he was helped by many along the way . a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . furura 's flute song was n't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one . jirarudan 's speech to them saying his collection ` started with a mew card ? ' ugh . even worse , misty 's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held . ` why did n't you put them in pokéballs when you caught them ? this is like caging them to be displayed . ' much different from whining about him thinking pokémon are things to be collected like stamps . if there were any real redeeming values in this , they came from team rocket . some pretty funny lines . not really to make me laugh out loud , but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . well , that was officially the last american pokémon movie i 'm going to see . i 've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . i 'll be importing the fourth one as well . forget you , kids wb and 4kids . you have forsaken me for the last time .

82	in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) .  now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever .  but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president .  it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics .  jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination .  he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) .  the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign .  he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) .  governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage .  to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby " the dustbuster " holden ( kathy bates ) .  the acting throughout primary colors is superb .  it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone .  she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance .  travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little .  emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run .  the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom .  primary colors treads lightly on this issue .  though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues .  in fact , most of the " bad guys " are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house .  rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control .  although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) .  primary colors' chief problem is its length .  it runs about 15 minutes too long .  there are some scenes which could have easily been cut .  for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists .  the scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film .  the extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film .  republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors .  it's a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process .  
83	too much of something borrowed grade b- super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year . because of this , movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend . every few years a studio releases a counter - programming female skewing movie ( 2001 's " the wedding planner " ) to compete with the big game . this super bowl weekend similarly titled " the wedding date " will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game .   sick of people feeling sorry for her , single - woman , kat ellis ( debra messing , tv 's " will and grace " ) hires male escort nick ( dermot mulrony , " about schmidt " ) to pose as her boyfriend for her sister 's wedding in london . her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married , and her ex- fiancé of seven years , who dumped her without a reason , is the best man . to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing . but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up , and let someone love her . the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies . it is almost a carbon copy of 1999 's " picture perfect " and mixes in scenes similar to " the wedding planner " and " my best friends wedding " . the movie also has a reverse " pretty women " theme going for it , and knowing her audience , the director makes clever references to that and other films . " the wedding date " has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie , there is the stereotypical overbearing mother ( holland taylor , " legally blonde " ) , and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner . the twist at the ending has been done before , but it was something that was n't completely expected . the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour . even though " the wedding date " is predictable , it is able to stand on its own . debra messing , in her first lead role , proves she can be charming and funny . dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing , but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic . he is able to make best of what he is given , and be able to salvage the character .   by the use of many clever puns ( often sexual ) , the film is actually funny . although primarily a chick - flick the film has components everyone can enjoy . the feel good story , and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time .

86	i'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool , humming " i will always love you " and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success .  it isn't necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in " kevin ! "  for at least a few more years .  begin by scribbling " the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long " somewhere you'll always see it , perhaps on the fridge door , or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick .  you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood : prince of thieves , where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman , but christian slater ( ! ) , several dozen tall trees , bows , arrows , and a canoe , too .  after dances with wolves and jfk , you decided the world needed more three hour movies , expensive three hour movies , so you starred in and produced wyatt earp ; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts .  wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes .  tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend , and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend !   ( she was played by joanna going in your movie-you know , the character known best in wyatt earp as " jew whore " .  what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking ? )  now , you're suffering the demise of yet another of your epics , the postman , a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworld's and tin cup's mildly lucrative box office takes .  the postman is not the worst movie ever made-people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along .  yet it is a ridiculous movie .  i suspect you thought you had another braveheart on your hands-why else line up two armies on horesback , all prepared for battle , for the climax of your film ? -but   " mailheart " the postman is not .   ( i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles : post encounters of the worst kind ; farewell , my salary ; howard the postman ; the postman's never watched twice . . . )  what a brown movie .  i hate brown .  you love brown .  dances with wolves was golden and brown-it looked like an eggo commercial .  the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes ; would the post-apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry ?  what exactly happened to this desert world , anyway ?  did we all become so stupid that we didn't immediately begin rebuilding homes , restaurants , and most importantly , shopping malls , after " the war " ?  why did you choose to drive the movie's plot with a dumb group of terrorists who , well , terrorize townfolk across america ?  why is it only * they * have ammunition , anyway ?  was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you , the drifter-cum-postman ?  why cast english actress olivia williams as an american ?  don't you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent ?   ( take a look at the less-than-stellar performances of an american-ized nicole kidman or an american-ized minnie driver . )  who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie ?  if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists , why didn't you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches ?  why cast will patton as the bad guy ?  because you worked with him in no way out ?  sure , he's a suitably creepy villain ; know why ?  because he's creepy in everything , including armageddon , in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit !  why heroize the most demonic institution in america , the u . s . postal system ?  was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty ?  if so , why didn't he look more skeletal ?   ( he should have been around 70 years old . )  why , oh why , do i have so many questions ?   ( i could ask plenty more . )  shouldn't a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything ?  you have one great line in this film , and you deliver it to a mule ! :   " the things i like about my ass . . . "  i had to wonder .  actually , i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes , a relaxed cynicism , if you'll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldn't resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country .  ultimately , i'm saying relax .  there is no quota , no need for you to make a picture a year .  settle down .  really question future screenplays before you commit to them .  feel free to write back .  i know how much you like letters .

89	janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker .  this is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs .  it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too .  garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection .  denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular .  so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit .  she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this .  the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on .  then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . "  it happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way .  in the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side .  no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage .  also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight .  that's how it works in movies like these .  i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits .  i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet .  garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss .  milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together .  rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara .  oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end .  what the message here ?  sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script .  i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together .  leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole .  he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche .  both of them should have known better .

91	sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking .  take this film , " naked killer " , among it's ingredients are heavy doses of violence , rape sequences , straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls " coarse language " .  but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ?  one word - penis .  that's it .  in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is " penis . " .  it really restores you're faith in the system , huh ?  anyway , that's just a side point .  when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne , it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip , cool , controversial thriller .  what they forgot to mention was that it isn't very good .  the plot involves male cop tinam ( simon yam ) , investigating a series of brutal murders .  while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty ( chingmy yau ) , who , after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father , falls in with professional killer sister cindy ( svenwara madoka ) .  realising kitty has potential , cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity .  however in the course of his investigation tinam ( who believed kitty had disappeared ) , runs into her again , but isn't quite sure if it's her .  to complicate matters the actual serial killlers , princess and baby , who a former students of cindy , and have been told to kill their old master and her new student .  from then the action ensues . . .  all in all , this is not a well done movie .  the script is awful , the direction all over the place , the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor .  however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain .  the shoot out in the car park is almost woo-like in adrenaline .  the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different .  let me put this way , if you like action - get something else , if you like strong women in movies - get something else , if you have do decide between this and " black cat " for your hong kong female action - don't get either .  even for curiosity value it just isn't worth it .  let's face it - if ever the was a movie that became popular on it's subject alone , this is it .

93	i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks .  i loved the wedding singer .  but it gets worse .  if i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence .   .   .  hell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i'm bound to be lynched .  well lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception .  right away , you're ready to discount my review , aren't you ?  you're thinking that i can't possibly know what i'm talking about .  after all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ?  well , there's more .   .   .  i actually got choked up , and more than once .  yes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes .  but before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself .  the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so .  but when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him .  in the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character .  julia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the " miami vice " loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn't seem all that interested .  as the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women .  it's obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ?  this isn't sleepless in seattle , but i'd actually compare it to that before i'd compare it to happy gilmore .  while the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way .  sandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously .  barrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple .  one scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears .  unfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it's got so much surprise substance packed inside that i'm encouraging everyone to go see it .  in fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar .  the 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) .  sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) .  while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars .  it's hilarious , and it's touching .  it's got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected .  this is one to see again and again .  is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ?  my " magic 8-ball " predicts it is certain .

102	weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches .  there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics .  spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story .  but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken .  in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films .  _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a " pr mission " to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day .  ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .  the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france .  there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie .  the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done .  the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat .  another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops .  the technical side of the film is peerless , as always .  the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw .  hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel .  yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events .  it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince .  throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) .  for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground .  here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man .  but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact .  there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) .  the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film .  ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war .  rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is " realistic , " it would be better to describe it as " having realistic moments . "  another aspect of the " hollywoodization " of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing .  anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup .   " who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? "  asks one infantrymen in the group of eight .  rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as " who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? "  or some variant thereof .  conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the " f " word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex .  this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an " r " rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film .  however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic .  the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg .  he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .  as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain .  that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film .  nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) .  because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows .   .  
103	writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard .  harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun .  harder than building a bridge over troubled waters .  and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review .  thrillers are all variations on a theme .  you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet .  you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process .  the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner .  this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . .  is anyone else getting depressed here ?  point is , it's not enough to follow the formula .  you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version .  something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals .  this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way .  without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails .  that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f .  bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire .  richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal .  the jackal is trying to kill someone .  gere is trying to stop him .  will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ?   ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . )  there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , " i wonder what happens next ? "  the script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines .  it's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium .  throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them .  no surprise .  the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy .  instead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) .  and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight .  it's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it .  and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not .  what's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids .  as for the performances . . .  bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie .  his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint .  richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance .  sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) .  writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done .  it wasn't done here .  it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones .  do not go see this movie .  you'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it .  instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud .  anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies .  
104	capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived .  this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . .  extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts .  beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep .  this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson .  instead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat .  not a good choice .  while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare .  the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director's style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters .  a . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion .  i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on .  but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping .  apparantly , everybody can now fly .  hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly .  better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess .  in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back .  or at least let robin shou direct . . .  b . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad .  i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious .  had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking .  but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished .  c . ) now for the _really_ bad parts .  i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series .  the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger .  the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride .  this could have been a really cool movie .  it isn't .  the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers .  some of the plot elements are just plain stupid .  how stupid ?  take , for instance , how our heroes move around .  they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh  boy . . .  even worse is the treatment of secondary characters .  blink and you'll miss 'em .  most characters had more depth in the video games .  if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet .  a good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about .  there's no explanation at all for this .  and for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended .  it almost made me weep .  to sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes .

106	yeah cheap shot i know , but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of ' deepness ' ( political turmoil , love / lust ) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim ( see also ' american beauty ' ) . kaufman 's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences ( in one scene i counted three different ' generic european ' accents affected by the actors ) and displays of state might run amok , yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered . and in its over - long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz , the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot , and in this manner sacrifices the novel 's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs . it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas ' son , used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel . combined with the overweening soundtrack , these flaws make this movie 's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content .

" ) .  things are a mess .  enter uma thurman .  the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls .  her character is fun to watch .  even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her .  like the lone ranger , before she leaves , she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives .  the ending is a bit too pat .  everything is tied up with a neat little bow .  rosie o'donnell is a stand-out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and " tell it like it is " pronouncements .  structured somewhat like a " diner , a few years later " , this feel-good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice .

125	jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .  from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances .  on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong .  and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality .  hush is one such example .  lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium .  the film opens , as many so-called " psychological thrillers " do , by posing as a light drama .  we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love .  jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) .  the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs .  soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) .  once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives .  as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war .  hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .  this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks .  frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .  meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .  as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .  here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .  of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .  maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus .  martha is , of course , the evil one .  how do we know she's evil ?  she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work .  on the other hand , helen is a good girl .  the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .  that's about it for character development .  beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .  however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .  i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .  either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script .  before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .  viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is .  cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable .  most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good .  films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .  in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .  that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .  indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .  
126	 " payback , " brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's " l . a . confidential " ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it .  mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( " conspiracy theory " and " lethal weapon 4 , " anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead .  porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay .  the tagline for " payback " is , " get ready to root for the bad guy , " and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way .  i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them .  just because the protagonist , a " bad guy , " is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will " root for him , " and i didn't .  quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) .  since none of the respectable actors in " payback " actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out .  lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's " ally mcbeal " ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat .  meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging .  unger , who made an impression in 1997's " the game , " is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .  finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) .  like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking .  in the course of the 102-minute running time of " payback , " porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer .  and guess what ?  not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) ,  even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag .   " payback " is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen .  perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours .

136	fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town .  joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago .  he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her .  she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher .  before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye .  a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station .  driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand .  but the deputy sheriff " buggs " meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him .  he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl .  the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect .  locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence .  in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping .  fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell .  the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him .  somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies .  katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died .  the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses .  joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge .  he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob .  an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder .  katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death .  the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse .  the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail .  the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob .  but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film .  as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe .  in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive .  when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened .  katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have .  but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive .  mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching .  instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script .  to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook .  his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .  you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves .  their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted .  lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident .  he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience .

147	when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " .  then it was going to be " you too can believe pastel triangles can fly " .  then , it was going to be " you too can believe wood sprites can fly " .  finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . .  there's a lot of flying going on in this film !  as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in .  well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released .  part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) .  subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) .  to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high .  in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us .  after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters .  is the format effective for the film ?  with a few exceptions , yes .  the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony .  it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily .  everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts .  eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things .  though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies .  the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's " the pines of rome " .  in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape .  a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack .  he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the " oceans " of clouds .  again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved .  reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size .  the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images .  one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent .  absolutely beautiful stuff .  the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's " rhapsody in blue " .  this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york .  there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife .  i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending .  unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments .  segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's " piano concerto no . 2 " and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's " the steadfast tin soldier " .  a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester .  the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina .  little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from .  the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl .  although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , " the steadfast tin soldier " is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short .  some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made .  segment five is the funniest of the bunch .  set to camille saint-saens " the carnival of the animals " , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number .  while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy .  segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , " the sorcerer's apprentice " .  the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo .  unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain .  there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain .  similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters .  segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's " pomp and circumstance march no . 1 " and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character .  donald duck " stars " as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark .  during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat .  they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners .  despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days .  powerful stuff .  segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? " saving the best for last " .  set to igor stravinsky's " the firebird " , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape .  trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation .  when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird .  in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create .  some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) .  the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny .  be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin .  penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting .  the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board .  pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's " ride of the valkyries " , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments .  for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon .  the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material .  as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters .  i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though .  then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .

151	cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success .  sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close .  this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops .  following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the " money train " --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash .  along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss .  this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film .  given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time .  robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history !  he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets !  but this is only one of money train's problems .  if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense .  but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse .  the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance .  the film isn't all bad though .  snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent .  but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie .  if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this .  but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here .

156	the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you , at times , cracking up .  the film takes place , for the most part , in real-time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood .  hrundi v . bakshi , played very well by peter sellers , is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland , india .  hrundi tries out his acting talents , but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job .  on the set of his current film that he stars in , hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse .  during the filming of this movie set in the 1800's , hrundi manages to annoy the director ( herbert ellis ) in any way he can .  this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set .  many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever .  and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .  edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood , everything is pretty much over for hrundi .  clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood .  but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck's exclusive party , hrundi is invited , and certain chaos is bound to occur .  of course , as predicted , hrundi causes lots of trouble .  each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous .  and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way .  the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations .  it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say " birdy num-num " ? ) .  if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy , check out the party .  it's not going to be one of your all-time favorites , but if you enjoy this type of humor , you'll enjoy the party .  
157	director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen .  nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's " pulled back in " to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) .  memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang .  memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well .  gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits .  in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects .  filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride .  and what follows doesn't disappoint . . .  cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . .  good or bad . . .  i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely .  of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class .  also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday .  none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately .  some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles .  delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner .  i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important .  the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . .  mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll .  there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the " rival car thief " plot line .  as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package .  but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . .  thereby adding some meat to the plot .  the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore .  it's all been done .  the chase is also shot and edited in that " jerry bruckheimer action sequence " kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene .  sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ?  it's very hard to tell .  finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the " bus jumping the ramp " sequence from speed in the " oh , i don't think so . . . "  department .  despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment .  it's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun . . .  just what a summer flick should be .

159	the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
160	 " be gentle , " urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in " the whole nine yards . "   " i haven't made love in five years . "   " neither have i , " rebuts perry .   " i'm married ! "  if jonathan lynn's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then it'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film .  instead , its failings go much deeper .  first off , who hasn't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ?  if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a " comedy " which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in .  who's next ?  jack nicholson and martin short ?  it certainly doesn't have to be funny .   " the whole nine yards " is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive .  offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete .  that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with .  when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as " barbecue , " it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end .   " the whole nine yards " is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects .  rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain-smoking french canadian who's married to matthew perry's none-too-successful dentist .  it's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust .  then there's natasha henstridge ( " species " i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis .  she gets involved with perry's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder's fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door .  henstridge and perry's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together .  perry might have the charm but he doesn't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close-up .  most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perry's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals .  peet's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off .  when " my cousin vinny " is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as " clue , " " greedy , " and " sgt .  bilko , " you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path .  perry's pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly .

162	tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies .  and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes .  i didn't expect much from this latest " interpretation " of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes .  i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those " damn dirty apes , " in one of his best roles of his career ?  sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off .  this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot .  leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered " smart " chimps into the storms to collect data .  leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle .  leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) .  the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship .  along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth !  in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene .  while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the " surprise " ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple .  wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences .  this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film .  the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human .  even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey .  but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton .  even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film .  even joel schumacher could have directed this film .  he probably should have .  burton's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet .  i suppose that's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole .  
163	some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .

169	in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system .  apparently , it was just lying dormant .  with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons .  ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island .  of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting .  while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche .  both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon .  naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates .  granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes .  but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island .  reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences .  his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back .  as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him .  holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) .  she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match .  formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer " popcorn " movie season's lack of substance .  it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach .  pass the popcorn .  
170	rich ditzy joan winfield ( a woefully miscast bette davis ) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice ( jack carson looking lost ) . her father ( eugene palette ) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins ( james cagney . seriously ) . they crash land in the desert and hate each other but ( sigh ) start falling in love . this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it . they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why ! the script is just horrible -- there 's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus ( this is done three times ! ) . only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . as it is they both do their best with the lousy material . cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it does n't work . carson has this " what the hell " look on his face throughout the entire movie ( probably because his characters emotions change in seconds ) . only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . but , all in all , this was dull and laughless -- a real chore to sit through . this gets two stars only for cagney and davis ' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really -- it 's not worth seeing . cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why .

174	i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume .  i was dead wrong about all of those things .  the emperor's new groove is funny .  damn funny .  and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones .  the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing .  the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over .  the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us .  the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia .  here's the plot ; try to follow along .  set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor .  when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her " assistant " kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama .  kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him .  then the fun starts .  for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination .  yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl .  the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) .  david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film .  spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times .  needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days .  the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is .  the sheer weirdness factor is very high .  cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal .  simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season .  kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue .  that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it .

176	john boorman's " zardoz " is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own .  not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .  of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent .  boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain " zardoz " ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful " exorcist ii : the heretic " ) .  boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent .  this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece " deliverance " ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama " hope and glory " ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic " excalibur " ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure " the emerald forest " ( 1985 ) .  his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste .  if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion .  unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around .   " zardoz " is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's .  his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even " the wizard of oz , " a book which figures into the movie's plot .  but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .  the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .  in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions .  it's more middle ages than space age .  the world of " zardoz " is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life .  these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society .  however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years .  if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals .  one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed .  like " the wizard of oz , " he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head .   ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . )  calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources .  from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , " the gun is good .  the penis is evil . "  that line alone is worth the movie's cult following .  one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex .  once there , the immortals label him a " brutal " and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them .  they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up .  i say " hilarious " because that is exactly what " zardoz " is .  it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .  just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .  boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of " deliverance , " which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .  he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( " 2001 " ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in " zardoz " besides the inadvertent humor .  sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .  he got exactly that in " zardoz , " and it's a wonder it didn't end his career .  i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .  is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?  is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?  or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ?  karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .  come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip .  people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .  
177	priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal . 
178	so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
179	there have been far too few mainstream films set in post - colonial africa , and the ones that have are a mixed bunch . this one , with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s , shows the best and worst values of africa , which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole . it also has shortcomings , given the undue influence of western pre - conceptions of africans and , especially , arabs . dr anansa linderby , the beautiful african - american wife of the english doctor david linderby , is captured by arab slave - traders , along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy . the lead slave - trader , suleiman , is every bit the stage arab , with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric , and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on " carry on follow that camel " but are not up the standard this film deserves . peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script , and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one - dimensional character . continuing the stereotypical theme , all three of suleiman 's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy , which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen . one of david 's first ports of call is the local police officer , a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat . david then meets two stereotypical white ex - pats , an englishman ( walker , played by rex harrison ) and an american ( sandell , played by william holden ) . sandell is a mercenary with " conventional " views on mixed - race relationships , who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front . won over by david 's love for anansa , and conscious of his own inability to find love , he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa . they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of sandell 's hesitation and david 's lack of experience with firearms , his helicopter is shot down but david survives . we then see david introduced to malik ( kabir bedi ) , an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance . they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman . in one of the most heart - rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman 's group , and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier . later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and , in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones , he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman 's henchmen . anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of suleiman 's two other employees . by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market . suleiman , now in no doubt that anansa is " trouble " , attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince ( omar sharif ) who is corrupt but intelligent . on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u.n. , the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences . the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film . at the slave market , the young boy is sold to a middle - aged german paedophile , and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered " wunderbar " when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch - doctoring skills . david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter - sweet ending from malik 's point of view . ultimately , david and anansa are re - united , and malik , whose life is in ruins , can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed . the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters . credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting .

186	i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults .  the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating .  however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away .  both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers .  even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts .  everyone loves surprises .  u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets .  this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off .  set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship .  there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 .  it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships .  the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) .  once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down .  as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop .  this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all .  the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations .  throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible .  germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny .  all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move .  they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .

195	by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .  gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .  tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .  minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .  the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .  that is until about half-way through the movie .  suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom .  but this is as close as you will ever get to it .  instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "  at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .  the last half of the film is very well done .  another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .  owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . "  before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .  but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .  gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .  although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .   ,  
196	" attack of the killer tomatoes " consists mostly of rambling , poorly assembled footage in search of a movie . the plot makes no sense , and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all . watching this silly spoof , you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately : that it 's easy to make a cheap , low - quality film and then use the " parody " angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality ( in one scene , female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them ; how far can " suspension of disbelief " go - even in a parody ? ) . the title song is great , though . ( * 1/2 )
197	[it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
198	okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest :  what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ?  whew . okay .  cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .  even i know that you need more footage than * that * .  and that wasn't the only thing getting on my nerves .  the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie .  at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace .  it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn't * die .  a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i'm willing to accept it because i'm willing to accept that this is how amanda's life is changed , how her powers are received .  later on , the movie can't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom .  and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary .  the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good .  some places the plot just doesn't make sense , sometimes it's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice .  can't beat that ) .  all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .  not romantic at all , and only funny in some places .  so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ?  or the fairy godfather ?  she can * float * now too ?  and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ?  tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda's " witchcraft " in the end ?  would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac's video ?  what the hell is up with that damn crab ?  it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome .  the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables .  the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) .  gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming " cruel intentions " ) than this sorry excuse for a character .  it's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .  the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in " you've got mail " ( see footnotes ) .  and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places .  this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too .   " simply irresistible " is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick .  and how could i refrain from making a pun ?   .   .   .   " simply irresistible " is all too easy to resist .   ( first viewing , 2/6/99 )   * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to " you've got mail " ( or " the shop around the corner " ) ?  business rivals fall in love .  female counterpart's business is in danger of being shut down .  female as mother- like figure guiding her .  the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends .   * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar's wardrobe .

204	the 14 year - old in me is immensely happy that they 're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies , and that they 're all the rage , what with lord of the rings , harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office . this year will see ( and already has seen ) several more , most notably the golden compass , which has the most exciting trailer i 've seen this year . stardust , based on a novel by neil gaiman , showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep . i saw no previews for it , only a couple of commercials . the critical reaction is kind of blah . i would n't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum , and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend . well , if you 'll forgive the horrible pun , the stars must have been rightly aligned , because i went to see stardust , and i loved it . it 's not a huge movie like lord of the rings . the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . but within that basic outline , the story is lively and imaginative . it 's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . and it succeeds wonderfully . there were a lot of big films this summer , but none of them were nearly as fun as this one . there 's a lot going on , but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent . it is n't a masterpiece , but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has ( though i do n't like it quite as much as the earlier film ) . a lot of fun to be had here if you 're a fan of the genre .
205	i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone .  sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out .  the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff .  hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in .  clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time .  and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it .  one girl said if i'd seen the movie with " an open mind , " i would have enjoyed it .  nothing could be further from the truth .  i went into the theater expecting to love the movie .  the preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters .  almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way .  when we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement .  so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter .  i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway .  what i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever .  and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like .  where to begin in criticizing this movie ?  the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .  there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence .  zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero .  so why does this movie get one star out of me ?  well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub .  and if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get .  alicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .  and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) .  as the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) .  the drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath .  they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party .  not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy .  at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated .  in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it .  so you can't call it a sex flick .  i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ?  bad .  
206	i want céline and jessie go further in their relationship , i want to tell them that they were made for each other , that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other . their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached . this is about love but not stupid things like in " notting hills " or those kind of movie . this is life and i did believe in them , i did believe they were falling ... this was so clever and touching . i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there ... i want to go to vienna . i want to see them as soon as possible again . i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake , a concept , but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere , somehow and some when , something could really happen . i 'm french and did n't know very well july delpy despite kieslowski " three colors : white " ... now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting . i saw " before sunset " ( the sequel in paris ) a few days before i saw " before sunrise " and their is no matter . they are both masterpieces . proof that you do n't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings . i 'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best . franck in france

252	with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well .  with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining .  however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere .  this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment .  considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing .  the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .  however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .  along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . )  they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens .  unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere .  the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier .  the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .  the actors and directing don't help , either .  hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .  stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman .  the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .  but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone .  the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through .  the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .  the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )  the writing doesn't help much , either .  although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud .  the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .  practically every line is just stating the obvious .  none of it is smart .  also , where the hell did the budget go ?  the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess .  there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .  i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .  but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .  finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .  levison can't handle his own plot .  it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .  and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )  it's not all that bad though .  the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .  but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie .  not really worth seeing .  overall rating= review by david wilcock

255	 " what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? "  that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie .  let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie .  so bad , it's almost good .  almost , but not quite .  the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth .  it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies .  the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody .  that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 .  he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies .  a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs .  it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs .  the acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse .  and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie .  the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow .  it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it .  actually , it was the high point of the movie for me .  of course , that isn't really saying much .  the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion .  which gives it a leg up on some other horror films .  unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story .  not a great one , but it is there .  this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies .  you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better .  but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon .  just don't be too upset if you can't find it .  you really won't be missing that much .  
256	cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
257	going down as the most expensive film in finnish history , to date , " dark floors " is a horror film with an extremely lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of " floors " ( ironically enough ) in an abandoned hospital , in which our protagonists are trapped . lead by an autistic daughter and her father , himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter , make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses . accompanied by a security guard , a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned , but they are not alone . directed by finnish- born pete riski , more known for his television work , " dark floors " is filmed in english , using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of finland 's arguably most famous group " lordi " ( 2006 eurovision song contest winners ) as themselves , i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes , as the films antagonists , yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most , in convincing the audience . any film that has their lead character use the phrase " it 's too quiet " is already headed down a dubious path , and this lordi influenced horror does not break that convention . for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clichés alongside and worst of all , anything that is interestingly original is n't fleshed out enough for it to resonate . the concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire . however , there is n't enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear , the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous , as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black , but i do n't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening . also , the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch , a concept not often used in the horror genre , but the characters do n't confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact , they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience . these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste , as if the director and/or mr lordi ( who had many of the ideas used within the film ) had these thoughts , but could n't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point .   yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy , yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for . too much is clichéd , too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous . while the lead is amicably acted by noah huntley , the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films . we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest . accompanying the " couple " we have the traditional token black man as a hard - nosed security guard , with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm , and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself . worst of all though , unfortunately , is the introduction of the cast of lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits , but not for them appearing as themselves . what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear . " the shining " is scary because it 's a member of your own family hounding you , in " dawn of the dead " it 's our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess , in " alien " the fear is explained , the creature is rationalised and in " dark floors " there is none of that . perhaps it 's unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it 's aggressors feel like nothing more than demented klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear , without a build up of any atmosphere " lordi " just are n't scary . it 's infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well , you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as " hollywood " churns out , much in the similar way that george a romero started out , but it does n't always materialise . i enjoyed the film and did n't feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through , but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously , emotionally or critically . i felt the almost lynchian narrative was a standout plus point , but it fades out into nothingness . why did it happen ? what does it mean ? will they go through this all again ? without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty . was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence ? had the autistic girl watched the eurovision song contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under ? who knows ? and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care . " dark floors " is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from mr lordi , who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas . it 's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation .

272	synopsis : a humorless police officer's life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist .  unfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl .  meanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie .  comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers .  technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles .   ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . )  the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago .  this really isn't a good movie .  have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ?  well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn .  they're awful .  these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an " action " movie called detonator starring scott baio .  scott baio !  what idiot dreamed this movie up ?  after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn .   " maybe it won't be * that * bad " he may say to himself .   " perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading .  watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago .  it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy .  lou rawls is even in the mix ! "  unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book .  the latter is really too bad .  koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer .  koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful .  people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices .  it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs .  watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books .  the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting .  basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat .  silly but kind of neat too .  i'm sorry .  i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie .  i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself .  this turkey is really cheesy .  no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero .  the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends .  mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity .  to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein .  you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts .  i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie .  and the creature !  yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling .  this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay .  the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing .  oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around .  cheesy gore .  that's another main element of watchers reborn .  it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense .  ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) .  also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this .  anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean .  finally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as " bot fodder " for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , " mystery science theater 3000 . "  this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face .  rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore .  it also has violence , obviously .  i wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay .  instead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz's book .  trust me , it'll be time much , much better spent .  
273	the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
274	gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit .  in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years .  without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated .   " the gift , " directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .  it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .  the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other .  annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .  for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future .  her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .  when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .  at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .  soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .   " the gift " may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's " for love of the game " ) lift the picture up several notches .  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery .  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's " the talented mr . ripley " ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .  blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's " boys don't cry , " hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .  as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's " the watcher " ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all .  for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .  giovanni ribisi ( 2000's " the boiler room " ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .  in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's " wonder boys " ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes .  finally , kim dickens ( 2000's " hollow man " ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda .  the other notable aspect of " the gift " is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating .  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread .  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , " the gift " is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .  it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .  
275	robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good .  it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script .  as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs .  first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit .  we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband .  we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .  then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live .  we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop .  we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion .  we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband .  she exclaims " here i come ! "  and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself .  soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out .  convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder .  she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard .  the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) .  meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success .  so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as " a southern spin on fargo , " except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade .  robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town .  indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional .  glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific " aunt alexandria " character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity .  the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill )  there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends .  cookie's fortune is such a movie .  i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter .  i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast .  i even liked the trite " in the south everybody is related to everybody " cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close .  i'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me .  perhaps it's that good ol' southern charm .  
276	with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .  for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .  lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .  it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .  this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .  so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life .  >from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like " sliding doors on steroids .  with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .  indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .  very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .  the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .  thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .  while you are watching , this will not matter .  running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted .  it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;

280	plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide .  critique : despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott's worst acting performances .  add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this " black comedy " ( if you're gonna create a black comedy , don't chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter .  i barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you're gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) .  this one's not even worth the rental , fellas .  skip it altogether !  little known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott's first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could've passed for hanks 15 years ago .  it wasn't until hanks' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott .  the actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv's " saved by the bell " .  his parents are dutch and named hans and paula .  and who would've guessed that this is director alan cohn's first shot at directing a feature film ?  
281	citizenx(1995 ) is the developing world 's answer to silence of the lambs . where ` silence ' terrorized our peace of mind , ` citizen ' exhausts and saddens us instead . this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well , thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals . citizenx may also argue against ( ! ) the death penalty far better than kevin spacey 's the life of david gayle(2002 ) . humans are machiavellian mammals , under which lie limbic brains ( lizard - logic ) . why did two kids , who knew better , stone to death a toddler they kidnapped ? why do bloodthirsty women yell ` li - lilililililii ' at acts of obscene terrorism ? -my own term for this is ` limbic domination ' , the lizard - logic urge to dominate an ` enemy ' . if you have the words ` enemy'/`vengeance ' in your vocabulary , you 're easily capable of ` limbic domination ' . in wwii - devastated 1980s rostov ( located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea ) , nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo 's urge for ` limbic domination ' from overpowering his layers of civilization . chikatilo(jeffrey demunn ) 's easy victims were paupers , usually children , who rode the interurban train for fun , since they could n't afford anything else . citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such ` lambs ' . rostov 's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years after the police arrested and let him go . the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world , in the west , vote - grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter - agency rivalries , stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . in the soviet union of citizenx , however , viktor burakov(stephen rea ) 's killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy . geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority -- to the point of complete obscurity . in real life , too , chikatilo had a lifetime 's experience blending in and evading capture . his pursuer , on the other hand , sticks out as a strange bird , given to unheralded , naive outbursts . perhaps by design , stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov . rea 's russian accent is impenetrable ; and his burakov is humourless and sullen , at odds with everyone . so it 's donald sutherland who walks away with the picture . sutherland 's col . fetisov , burakov 's boss , and at first his only supporter , is an overly restrained , patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . his reawakening as a logic - driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film 's cornerstone idealism . joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik , secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk , overseeing the investigation . naturally , he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect , a communist , in 1984 , a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag , supposedly going home : andrei chikatilo . soon , he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik , detective gorbunov(john wood ) , insisting that the investigation now focus on ` known homosexuals ' . the funniest scene of this sad , sad film comes during bondarchuk 's & gorbunov 's institutionalized harassment : one stupid cop earnestly reports , ` as i suspected , comrade , it 's fornication . i 've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter . 5yrs after the bodies began piling up , in 1987 , the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky(max von sydow ) , who termed the unsub ` citizenx ' . he later also observed to fetisov & burakov that ` ... together you make a wonderful person ' . we concur . the drawn - out pace , spread over a decade , perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost--`openness'--that was n't . the contrast with perestroika--`restructuring'--couldn't've been greater for the case . although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations , police plans were about to bear fruit . in 1990 , col . fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general . his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene , allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . staff , communications , publicity -- suddenly all were available . in just one night of telephoning around , fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi 's serial murder task force at quantico , where , fetisov discovered , staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators . fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief , now ` colonel ' burakov , of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie 's powerhouse watershed scene . fetisov 's is the most tender apology i 've ever seen on film : ` privately , i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance ' , he almost whispers . a hbo production , citizenx is a film of the highest caliber . not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak ( shot exclusively in the most run - down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest ) , but randy edelman 's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming -- and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits . chikatilo 's actual murders are depicted as bleak , aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world . this makes the murders seem not - entirely - out - of - place -- but of course they were . as president kennedy reminded us , ` we all cherish the futures of our children ' . citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply . serial rapists rape to dominate ; serial killers kill to dominate . so do some soldiers . such ` limbic dominators ' make poor humans . warning - spoiler:----------------------------------------------- the real andrei chikatilo was the world 's most prolific known serial killer . convicted , he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences : one shot , in the back of the head . foolishly , such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death . conclusion:------------------------------------------------------------ the best outcome is always the prevention of killings , not their prosecution . executions merely guarantee society 's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims ' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how / why they died . nor do killers learn regret if they 're dead . vengeance does n't unkill victims . baying for the killer 's blood constitutes nothing better than counter - domination -- once it 's too late . vengeance on behalf of the grieving is n't justice for the deceased -- it 's appeasement of the living.(10/10 )

291	a common complaint amongst film critics is " why aren't there more literate scripts available ? "  quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content .  paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors .  the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g .  a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed .  deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script .  redford departs from the usually overlight , " cable tv quality " sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces .  quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years .  although i was only 4 years old when the " twenty one " scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette .  from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without " disposable income , " before the manifestation of its american dream .  the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from " the good life , " to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame .  though the 50s audience that is " rocked " by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding .  charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day .  the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf .  at the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff .  like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this " mirror " may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with .

296	i don't box with kid gloves .  i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film .  i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic .  however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery .  rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time .  i still , however , will not go easy on them .  they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it .  in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets .  well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence .  the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me .  sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable .  down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report .  like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail .  the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s .  a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . '  in down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent .  with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters .  again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about .  the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) .  the plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all .  from there we go into a delightful parody .  the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books .  we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast .  although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out .  for once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online .  i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself .  it's almost as much fun as the film .

303	salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets .  actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .  proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .  face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .  one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that .  realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins .  terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .  although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired .  on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .  martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway .  unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .

305	by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .  after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .  the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .  as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .  lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist .  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .  he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .  two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .  lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .  it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start .  there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp .  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film .  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .  it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .  even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .  unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .  once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable .  in fact , " stale and predictable " describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents .  it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .  played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling .  instead , stuart places his trust in a " name " star who can't carry the material .  maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .

307	 " the end of the affair " is a dark and moody romantic period piece , that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs .  although it's slow and sometimes confusing to follow , it still manages to give audiences a moving experience .  based on graham greene's novel of the same name , the film mainly follows 3 characters .  there's maurice bendrix ( ralph fiennes ) who has an affair with henry mile's ( stephen rea ) wife sarah ( julianne moore ) .  sarah finds henry to be a bore , because well , he's just a normal guy .  it's all work and no play with him .  while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah , and would do anything for her .  unfortunately the two break up .  this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks , so that leads us to the present .  it's a few years later , and they both still think of each other , so maurice hires a private detective ( ian hart ) to see what sarah is up too .  while this may sound straight forward it's not .  it's a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men , unhappiness , and the ever lasting love .  all this may sound like a drag , but it really captures your interest .  with great performances by ralph fiennes ( doing another english patient type of film , only this movie is better ) and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999 , i believe this was the role , she had the most passion for , and you can see why .  the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan .  even though i didn't read the book , there's no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive .  what's so moving about it you ask ?  the tragedy of it all .  it's not the typical romance , in which a guy finds a girl , they fall in love and all is well , this is more complicated and depressing .  it really shows the complexity of a relationship , because nothing is ever perfect .  everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces .  back to neil jordan's script , it wasn't only red roses .  there were times when i felt it too be a little slow , but most romances are .  it also tended to be a bit confusing , especially at the start .  it keep jumping around from past to present , so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things .  also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan .  i'd have to say this is his finest achievement to date , because quite frankly i've never really found his work to be up to par .  it just never did anything for me , until now .  when it ends , it leaves viewers a little saddened , but provoked nonetheless .  this is definitely one of the best films of 99 , and had some of the best acting , most notably by moore .  not for all movie goers , but for those who are film buffs and want something of value .

309	capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen .  one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .  the idea is something about ghosts and the internet .  the film has an amazing apocalyptic style .   , +2 ( -4 to +4 )  perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? )  filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa .  his films all seem to have one style , bleak .  the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold .  little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver .  most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid .  his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with .  cure is probably his classic .  last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon .  that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story .  pulse is kurosawa back on form .  taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software .  two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment .  taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software .  meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .  when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself .  if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall .  taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus .  people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide .  but they are not entirely dead .  their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet .  people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost .  if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow .  the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist .  this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing " like a computer disk . "  instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses .  there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers .  leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death .  this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work .  it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish .  kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion .  frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact .  his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange .  junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone .  images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain .  scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might .  people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence .  seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary .  kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread .  of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch .  i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

316	once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) .  unwittingly befriended by a non-stop talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner .  his prize ?  to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad's bride .  the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in " shrek . "  it took four writers ( ted elliott and terry rossio ( " the road to el dorado " ) , roger s . h .  schulman ( " balto " ) and joe stillman ( " beavis and butthead do america " ) ) to adapt william steig's children's book .  the bad news ?  they've genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman's " the princess bride . "  the good news ?  there's so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches .  we get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of farquaad's men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks' rendition of disney's animated pinocchio .  meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured  by farquaad spits icing and yells 'eat me ! '  before breaking down and solemnly asking 'do you know the muffin man ? '  shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) .  donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek .  donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon .  the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been expecting .  when fiona's true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek .  the script's details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad's dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and 'it's a small world' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona 'snow white' style .  popular culture is represented with film references to " babe " and " charlies' angels " via " the matrix . "  myers chooses his 'so i married an axe murderer' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft .  while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not .  eddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney's 'mulan ? ' ) .  lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious , height-challenged villain lord farquaad .  diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona .   ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who's proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney's " tarzan , " " princess mononoke " and the " south park " movie . )  the computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar's work ( " toy story , " " a bug's life , " " toy story 2 " ) .  in keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer's voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a 'dating game' parody broadcast by snow white's evil queen's mirror , farquaad is told 'fiona likes pina coladas' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) .   " shrek " has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family .  while it may be derivative of the 1987's " the princess bride , " " shrek " addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't suffer in the comparison .  
317	i can hear the question already .  what on earth do these two movies have in common ?  to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors .  as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .  but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .  while " everyone's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is .  i left " everyone says i love you " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .  i left " the portrait of a lady " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .   " everyone " features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise .  woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .  similar situations happen to his family and friends .  some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his " early , funny " films .  the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of " take the money and run , " his directorial debut .  however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits .  in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important .  yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .  but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling .  and what better way to express feeling than through music ?  love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart .  some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there .  it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him .  their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) .  but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience .  granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders .  jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in " portrait of a lady , " too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one .  campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind .  unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting .  i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people .  even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten .  the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material .  it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone .  the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them .  i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives .  jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity .  in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes .  unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film .  in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it .  so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them .  why ?  with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only " everyone says i love you " was able to make my heart sing .  
318	capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie .  presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock .  i've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art .  no , i haven't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i don't even know what it's about , but i can look at the way they're promoting it , and i know i've seen it already .  i thought : it's about these two cops .  and they're buddies , sort of .  they're at each other's throats a lot , but they really do like each other .  and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they're hot-shots .  and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship .  and one day they're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying .  and the bad guy is a drug lord .  and there's a witness , and she's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way .  and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down .  i only missed the bit about the badges .  the rest i got dead-on .  and i hadn't even left the video store yet .  the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo .  smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds .  this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence's " not getting any " , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife's " back door man " .  not funny ; tiresome .  bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence .  will smith is a natural , and i'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . .  and men in black .  he's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself .  martin lawrence is a different story ; he's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial .  movies like this are not about originality .  i know this .  they are about style and energy and synergy between actors .  i know this , too .  and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up .  i'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix .  bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified .  i could write this movie .  you could write this movie .  many people have .  many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again .  other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it .  more the fools we all .  in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange .  one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other .  the same could be said about this movie .  i have the sinking feeling we're going to see it again .  soon .

323	i have never been a " star trek " fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them .  i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , " star trek : insurrection , " is no exception .  dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , " first contact , " " insurrection , " tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth .  at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out .  also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise .  after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force .  so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties .   " star trek : insurrection , " is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's " first contact , " which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different .  in , " insurrection , " however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement .  the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff .  meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly .  this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast .  are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ?  another element of , " star trek , " films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later .  although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , " first contact . "  she should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller .   " star trek : insurrection , " is perhaps the weakest film in the " star trek , " series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , " star trek v : the final frontier . "   " insurrection , " is the type of " safe " sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts .  on second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out .  that way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness .

333	can you say " dated " ?  you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .   " mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too .  rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .  it all seems so harmless in the beginning .  mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .   ( there's also a skull in the living room , but it's only for decoration . )  their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .  all's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out .  when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .  it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .  and everyone's helping with the pregnancy .  the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6  years .  meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .  before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .  that's when you know your health's failing .  the only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .  by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .  rosemary's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .  i guess someone put a spell on this movie .

339	for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films -- the western assault on traditional serbian values -- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives . this continuous theme , expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle , is one that kusturica has elected to mandate . since his fantastic work and magnum opus ' underground ' , kusturica 's films ' ' black cat white cat ' , ' life is a miracle ' , and recently with ' promise me this ' , his slapstick , carnivalistic style underscores the ' westernization ' of balkan culture , its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom . in the case of ' promise me this ' , the paradoxical world of city ( urban space ) and village ( traditional idiom ) space are contrasted . the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting ; organized crime , sexual exploitation , a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values -- as expressed toward the young kid -- villager . the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one - way dirt road . they are on a collision coarse ; appropriately , the wedding , which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village , i.e. traditional values , are about to collide with the funeral mourners , exemplifying the death of tradition within this context . yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique , stylistic singularity . with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal .

346	the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
347	 . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
348	if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
349	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
350	a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
351	watching this movie made me think constantly ; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes ? there are a million options to slow down the car ! in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car was n't able to stop ... there are n't many good things to say about this film ; all the usual narrative cliche 's make their appearance , the actors are very bad , the story is as leak as a sieve etc . that makes this movie a waste of time and money .
352	many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
353	a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
354	the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
355	transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
356	an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
357	swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults .  steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie .  and he knows a money making winner when he sees one .  the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster .  hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro .  a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife .  the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead .  however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro .  banderas motive ?  to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie .  with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners .  banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease .  hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work .  as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way .  the audience does hate them , which can't be bad .  catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance .  the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones .  there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together .  the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly .  the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well .  the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding .  although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment .  however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed .  it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel .  screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script .  although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent .  there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together .  the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off .  this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines .  however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going .  in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades .  it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account .  you won't regret it .  
358	omar epps is an outstanding actor . i really think he gets into his character alot . when deja gets shot he shows true emotion . he also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room . omar is a very talented actor ! !
359	why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .   " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .   " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .  meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .   " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . "  the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .  dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .  even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .  the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .  it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack .   " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it , " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .  it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which " the iron giant " has in spades .  
360	the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
361	it was agonizingly bad movie . it will eat your heart out while you watch it . i beg you : do n't watch this movie ! you will hate you losing 1,5 hours of your lifetime ! it 's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy ... this movie is boring as ... there is nothing as boring as this movie . you will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end . and you will hate yourself that you did n't listen to me . i hate myself . i tortured myself and i did watch this movie to the end . now excuse me , i will shot myself . i have seen all . please . read this very carefully . do n't watch this film . please !
362	the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
363	the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
364	do not see this film . 
365	it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
366	by applying definition to both sides of the man , the picture realizes a fullness that does not negate the subject . 
367	in many ways , " twotg " does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories .  there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold .  but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us " the usual suspects " .  his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry .  the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) .  these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough .  their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive .  given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter .  yet , they are incredibly foolish planners .  actually , these two never really have a plan .  they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked .  their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family .  if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on .  what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss .  moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her .  these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations .  they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high .  but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways .  the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation .  during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed .  because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome .  we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause .  as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge .  the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur .  the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money .  you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement .  in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it .  yet , for the most part , " the way of the gun " stays on target .  it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry .  
368	the characters in " palmetto " collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce .  this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke .  as far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- " palmetto " spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming .  it's not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise .  harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he's served a couple of years for a crime he didn't commit .  even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry's first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) .  while searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire .  rhea proposes a scheme that'll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny ) .   " you do like risks , don't you , mr . barber ? "  rhea alluringly coos .  boys , form a line behind me .  part of " palmetto " 's success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in " leaving las vegas " might merely be foreshadowing great things to come .  shue's a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish .  the other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( " kids " ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in " bound " and " showgirls . "  harrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to " the people vs . larry flynt . "   " palmetto " does have its share of grievances .  harrelson's narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon's nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is .  one of the plot's unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he's involved -- could have been played a little better .  there are moments when you question the tone , but it's never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it's been receiving from most other critics .  if " palmetto " didn't want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action " who framed roger rabbit " ?  although a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms .  thanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer's suddenly re-popular " the tin drum , " right ? ) ,  everything runs smoothly .  and for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film's got a few shocks in store that i won't even dream of revealing .   " palmetto " is a generous amount of fun to watch , and that's all you need to know .  
369	deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
370	its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
371	the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
372	plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth , oops . . . i  mean , an evil man .  he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ?  anyway , fourteen years go by and . . . arrgh , well , you know the rest . . . swish-swish-zzzzzzz !  critique : this is a pretty bad movie .  let's see , where should i start ?  okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring .  it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy .  okay , what's next ?  acting , you say .  hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) , and mena suvari , is just plain off .  not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons & dragons , but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes .  now i'm not sure if this was ms . suvari's fault or the director's , but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film .  the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible " bad guy " , but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before . . . a  thousand times . . . by the same guy ! !  tim , please . . . for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day " american roles " for you as a " nice guy " in a romantic comedy or something .  stretch , dude . . . stretch ! !  we all know that you can do much better than this gunk .  alright , what else was bad in this film ?  oh yeah , the score !  yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ?  this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy .  i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a " real epic " by any stretch of the imagination .  it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some " shrewd " studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole " kung-fu " phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic .  dudes . . . you  failed all around !   ( keep reading )  the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful !   ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ?  why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ?  why doesn't anybody look a day older , when the sequence says " 14 years later " ?   ( at least . . . change  your shirt , man ! )  keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a " fun time " , but this flick just didn't cut it for me .  it was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the " romantic " scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ?  i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its " raison-d'etre " , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film .  i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film .  the first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders .  the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap .  and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ?  hullo ?  the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers .  deneuve is barely in this movie !  ugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash .  now say it together , gang : " all for one , and one for all . . . we  vow to stay away from it all ! ! "  thank me later .  where's joblo coming from ?  a knight's tale ( 7/10 ) - american outlaws ( 5/10 ) - crouching tiger , hidden dragon ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the replacement killers ( 6/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )

376	the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
377	kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress . you can tell always she 's just " acting " . i like izzard though . plot is awfully boring . the viewer has no real connections to the characters , never knowing who to really sympathize with , or even care about . slow , dull movie , with some laughs , but few and not very funny anyway . plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least . you can see each plot turn coming a mile away . what is this movie supposed to be ? comedy ? drama ? who cares ? you wo n't by the end of this film .
378	my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
379	i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this " horror " movie . i did not get scared even once while watching it . it also is not very suspenseful either .... i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie ... so .. what 's left ? " the ring " is a trully scary movie ... i wish other movies would stop copying from it ( e.g. the trade - mark : long hair ) . please give me some originality . will not recommend this movie .
380	as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
381	entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
382	tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
383	ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
384	godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
385	like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
386	like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
387	hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
388	though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
389	even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
390	the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
391	this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
392	the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive .  this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail .  what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane .  when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior .  but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time .  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately .  to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not .  snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later .  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge .  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing .  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie .  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife .  nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot .  the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face .  it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either .  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average .  and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie .  stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out .  it's director is the usual action movie style .  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith .  but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun .  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  
393	a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
394	one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
395	i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of " indiana jones and the temple of doom " . unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn . not like any yawn i have had before though . this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie . the cover described amazing special effects . there were none . the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed . it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence . good if you want to teach your kids that . i do n't . keep away from this one . if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere .
396	easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
397	 . . . too dull to enjoy . 
398	cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ?  it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time .  recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others .   ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ?  they are likely to be remembered for .   .   .  well , quite a while . ?  i like this film , too . ?  yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ?  true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ?  and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ?  in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable .  i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through .  of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together .  the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters .  yes , you read that right .  armageddon actually has characters you can care about !  if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be .  if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story .  it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .  so , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it .   ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )  their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .  the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .  his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j .   ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .  there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter .  a . j .  and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation .  it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon .  it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff .  it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens .  but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better .  i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .  take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .  a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .  the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .  i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch .  it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .  but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .  the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .  deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .  special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work .  everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .  the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art .  of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .  the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .  much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots .  i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .  in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story .  bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .  tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .  patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving .  the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny .  i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much .  but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .  it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema .  it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .  i'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .  what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .  
399	with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
400	eric rohmer's " pauline at the beach , " is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally .  the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) .  on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) .  while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) .   " pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story .  instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film .  this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's " my night at mauds , " and 1971's " claire's knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote .   " pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing .  
401	note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour .   ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . )  while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out ) .  the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis .  it's also vastly more convincing with its argument .   " mathematics is the language of the universe , " insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture .  since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning .  obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system .  sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness .  the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood .  it helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist .  all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries .  for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest .  still , we do care about max's fate .  teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions .  as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary .  pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality .  the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective .  in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction .  it's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings .   ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . )  using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts .  pi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) .  the film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity .  still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour .  at one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . .  computer chip .   " isn't it beautiful , " she coos .  a showcase for mr . aronofsky's technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year .  
402	it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
403	i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
404	the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
405	if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
406	the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
407	this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .

410	director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .  film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something .  but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .  so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review .  and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment .  fincher's the game is no exception to this .  the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .  fincher hasn't made a film since " seven , " his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever .  so it is about time he made another film .  and what a ride it is .  the game isn't quite as powerful as " seven , " but in some ways it is better .  overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty .  it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end .  the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight .  unfortunately , unlike " the usual suspects , " we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false .  however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent .  the game is told completely from its main character's point of view .  nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .  he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion .  for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services .   " it will make your life fun again , " his brother promises .  as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates .  seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company .  jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games .   " each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , " explains feingold .  one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests .  even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company .  what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun .  the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way .  how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .  the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .  with " seven , " fincher had almost every single shot mean something .  he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .  compared to " seven , " though , the game is light and comical .  because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously .  so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to .  what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .  if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense .  but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .  perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .  while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .  we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .  the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .  michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .  douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance .  his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody .  can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?  what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?  douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his " falling down " persona ) .  the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical .  sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother .  deborah kara unger ( from " crash " ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good .  in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas .  james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament .  another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from " shine " ) as the book editor .  but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .  the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs .  what is essential for this film to work is the writing .  john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments .  this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .  however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .  and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .  
411	warning : contains what the matrix is .  rated r for sci-fi violence .  starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix .  i'll tell you i was .  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .  now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it .  what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow .  now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .  don't be fooled , this movie has a big story .  and big chunks of talky moments .  but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .  ok now to the story .  well this may take a while .  ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .  a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .  he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be .  but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .  laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .  but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .  yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .  the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .  now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie .  some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .  the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .  but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .  one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .  
412	a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
413	a slight but sweet film . 
414	in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in .  we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves .  without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye .  even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema .  but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ?  exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept .  is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ?  midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth .  as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration .  during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . '  as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . '  a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone .  having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody .  joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream .  he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance .  by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing .  just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success .  but how realistic are these ideals ?  joe had raped and been raped in texas .  the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas .  alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation .  the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention .  schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny .  we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame .  he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york .  in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself .  standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh .  schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation .  beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison .  the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation .  it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men .  joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . '  there are two predominant images of new york .  the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty .  the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth .  joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter .  mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men .  joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions .  the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity .  what has become of joe's american dream ?  schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party .  joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex .  at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami .  contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence .  there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors .  the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals .  joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils .  the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent .  as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him .  his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished .  for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity .  tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami .  the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window .  instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe .  reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice .  the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before .  the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream .  no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means .  midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream .  there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family .  then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city .  joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york .  during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man .  an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .

422	this is the movie not the perfume .  a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo .  it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader .  set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy .  his real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes .  upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed .  inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers .  but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found .  grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop .  sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife .  when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife .  her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying .  he falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her .  sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him .  the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow .  it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .

424	this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while .  with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors .  his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws .  obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake .  but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors .  it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) .  casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school .  no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first .  while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic .  all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) .  as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours .  half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in " beverly hills " ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images .  the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects .  there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around .  i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ?  there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended .  this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality .  but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind .  the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth .  johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents .  but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose .  and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid .  anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league .  dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also .  they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat .  and guess what ?  that's about as complex as it gets .  oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it .  he's my fifth nom for a razzie .  the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act .  naturally , they win , or sort of half-win .  of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs .  the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ?  isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ?  the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero .  well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .

435	a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family .  the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based .  my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? )  i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film .  it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture .  for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , " a graduate of several 12-step programs . "  stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles .  stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking .  then , disaster strikes .  stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked .  he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up .  franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people .  although smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy .  also , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought .  although filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion .  for a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called " serious dramas " of today .  all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit .  if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out .  you'll laugh . . . you'll  cry . . . . it's  all there .  
436	1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 .  his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression .  in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful .  one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery .  as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers .  unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy .  to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture .  firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot .  the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively .  we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people .  during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive .  flash-forward a year .  now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) .  but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual .  a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom .  led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border .  along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) .  eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy .  firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good .  unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen .  these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game .  the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating .  everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions .  there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat .  as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache .  he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero .  my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume .  there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list .   ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . )  and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie .  as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments .  the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool .  the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .

438	birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives .  are we doing what we want to be doing ?  what happened to our dreams ?  with the new millennium , our collective big birthday , just around the corner , some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence .  the old standbys of traditional religion and science aren't doing it for many anymore and they're looking for something else .  we'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years .  ricky hayman ( jeff goldblum ) is having a career crisis .  the programming director for the good buy home shopping network , he's going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically .  new producer kate newell ( kelly preston ) is supposed to whip things into shape .  when the two are fixing a flat , they almost run down new age pilgrim " g " ( murphy ) .  g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap .  in some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour .  ricky is saved .  the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all .  it's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity .  it _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog .  i am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat .  you should take time to smell the roses .  selling your soul for cash is a bad idea .  golly .  i'm glad i saw the movie .  i never would have thought of these .  the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed .  when g takes a chainsaw to the set , there's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious .  it doesn't happen .  the bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience .  murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better .  there are hints of promise in this one .  the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen .  the others are horrendous .  goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his " invasion of the body snatchers " .  his relationship with kate makes no sense .  they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen .  preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be .  somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value .  an attempt to satirize stupid television , we get a self-parody instead .

455	director doug ellin's kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story .  like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it , the movie meanders along insulting the viewers' intelligence in almost every frame .  the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you've heard before .   ( " i'm not wearing any underwear , " the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster , max , in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line . )  max , chicago's biggest playboy , decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam , short for samantha .  max and sam possess two irritating personalities , and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience .  max is played without any style by david schwimmer .  schwimmer , whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality , makes an unlikely lover .  his costar , mili avital as sam , is cut from the same cloth , so they can be argued to be a matched pair .  after all , people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other , ditto for similar looks , so why shouldn't the personality-challenged be attracted ?  the implausible plot has max asking his best friend , jay ( jason lee ) , to hit on sam as a test .  jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him , but stop short of the actual act .  max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does .  the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work .  neither the script nor the actors make this test believable .   " the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you're with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ? "  jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film .  finally , there is the film's attempt at physical comedy .  jay's ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .  natasha rips jay's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa .  as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it .  this is supposed to be funny ?  most films have some saving grace .  some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn't .  kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it .  kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 .  it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .

459	the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .   ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . )  while driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt .  maj . archie gates' ( who's steering ) command requests a beach boys tune .  these men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles .  our three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs .  they are gates , new father sgt .  troy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt .  chief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt .  conrad vig ( music video director jonze ) .  at story's start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends .  barlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an " ass-map " that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion .  gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt .  ditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy .  so is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam's men are threatening the dictator's detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence .  when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help .   ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )  gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .  the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .  but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .  the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .  barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .  his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .   ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )  i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .  it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .  russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother .   ( it's great . )  his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .  one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence .  when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .  three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture .  stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .  newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .  one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .   ( a friend enthusiastically added , " it's like having sand in your eyes . " )  this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .   ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )  russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant .   ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . )  if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .  its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell .  subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status .   ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )  clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , " let my people go ! "  hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .   ( it's not spoiling much to write that . )  then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?   ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . )  russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .  if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .  with flair .  
460	i am of " the christopher reeve generation " it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet , but that does n't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role , and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top , though he just barely falls short . that does n't stop me from enjoying this film , it has a lot going for it . it has all that a movie needs , a plot with beginning , middle , and end , plus all those parts are intelligently written . the film is edgy both in acting and storyline , something a film - noir but with tights . the story is both exciting and meaningful , this is a movie with a message that is n't too preachy . i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days , oh the glory days of hollywood , when we did n't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell ... the film is polished and expertly made , directed by lee " roll'em " sholem , best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down , in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight , including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman 's point of view , also a few closeups of george in process work , and a long shot of an animated superman .   this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series . a dvd worth owning in its own right , the inclusion of the film as its original whole , is icing on the cake . give blood today god bless !

464	bad . bad .  bad .  that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls .  if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ?  still haven't got the point ?  other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie .  that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay .  after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face .  this movie stinks out loud .  quite frankly , this movie deserves a .  but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny .  so i'm giving it a .  and maybe that is too generous .  right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands .  not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform .  i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene .  to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film .  with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained .  so what is this movie about ?  you ask .  like it really matters .  ok , here goes .  this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry .  once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them .  everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral .  there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing .  >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here .  other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have .  the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts .  mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of " hey man " , " dig " and my all time favorite -- " this is my happening , and it freaks me out " .  now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ?  ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue .  maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter .  i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting .  but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie .  i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey .  in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries .  add to the directing and writing the music in this movie .  i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers .  then we have the cast .  first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band .  this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera .  sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks .  if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you .  meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets .  dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band .  and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents .  and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents .  sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest .  hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review .  then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members .  this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie .  meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all .  sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows .  on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene .  i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine .  but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked .  and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey .  the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it .  unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too .  and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet .  this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs .  an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense .  proceed with extreme caution .

466	the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .  alas , it refers to our heroes !  as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further .  after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one .  but the human race doesn't have much to worry about .  after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus .  she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) .  they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters .  lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board .  the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship .  soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened .  finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship !  it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race !  virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation .  when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene .  it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising .  i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative .  virus takes itself seriously .  and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming .  but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .  okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity .  they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) .  on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people .  after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around .  the leader , of course , is a big creature .  every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around .  virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening .  it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there .  on one level , virus is almost passable fun .  it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) .  there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) .  the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie .  it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .  in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .

470	all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly .  beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo . com ,  an online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour .  designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com .  by december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention .  the company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . .  until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era .  by april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations .  unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations .  the contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing .  the film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming .  the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise .  the most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses .  in the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls .  in the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe .  screened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival .  
471	the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad .  i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen " get carter " i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie .   " get carter " falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room .  you might call them the " steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . "  you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development .  they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at .  sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral .  he believes his brother ? richie was " taken out " and didn't die from a dwi accident .  carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid .  his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his " rambo-on-testosterone-therapy " voice .  stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself .  the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death .  he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well .  mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) .  there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives .  i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible .  i could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all .  i don't like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally .  yes , " get carter " is just that complicated and complex .  and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like " the usual suspects " for example - just the opposite .  you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't remember what had already happened and didn't figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax .  all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn't a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes .  although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another .  making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters .  mel gibson starred in " payback " a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter .  so ultimately " get carter " fails for pretty much every selling point it has .  carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not .  the action sequences are not at all exciting or original .  the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) .  in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results .  the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible .   * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .

476	contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place .  we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops .  anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead .  it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment .  jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals .  and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth .  after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport .  from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook .  the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power .  the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right .  it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane .  in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults .  the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge .  she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge .  we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far .  contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles .  matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) .  john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r .  hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding .  angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine .  most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances .  zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape .  always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning .  the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure .  and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump .  effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump .  it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised .  the thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining .  for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- " a journey to the heart of the universe . "  and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .  
477	clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death .  this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . .  chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue .  the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all .  when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . .  and in what room , and with what object .  while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments .  it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends .  to this day , whenever someone says the phrase " well , to make a long story short " i have the follow up phrase " too late " ready to go .  the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest .  and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well .  clue is available on dvd from paramount home video .  it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer .  a french language audio track is also available .  the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke ) .  also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice .  when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings .  if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times .  so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . .  the first two endings being " what if ? "  endings and the third ending being the actual ending .  now for the dvd release you get two choices .  you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you .   ( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this .  after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it .  when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . )  now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well .  first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ?  maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only .  i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish .  secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction .  finally , the back of the dvd case states " and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings " .  i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest .  the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time .  these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd .  the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

487	play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .  rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .  something that he has not yet successfully achieved .  rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace .  both men are nearing the end of their " almost " careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .  when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .  our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot at a future title fight .  the film is divided into two sections .  at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's " sassy grassy " green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .  along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .  once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .  both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here .  mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .  the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .  mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .  weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .  the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .  tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .  because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .  but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .  writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .  if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .  as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .  the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .  the phrase , " play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal .  that is a biblical principle .   " know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?  so run , that ye may obtain . "  1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv]  achieving anything worthy in life requires " playing it to the bone " .  we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives .  this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives .  as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time .  but as a principle of life , the phrase " play it to the bone " are words to live by .

491	one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .  and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .  her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .  but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .  and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .  written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .  alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .  as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .  walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .  ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .  she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .  she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .  and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .  thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .  the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .  ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .  walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .  when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , " money versus values . "  ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .  sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .  it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .  lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .  lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .  and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .  lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .  i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .  the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .  joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .  alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .  the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .  as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .  and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

518	despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky , i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because i 'd heard that it did not get great reviews . however , i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky is . there was no bad acting at all in the whole film , every single character is believable . the romantic moments between cruise 's character , david aames and cruz 's character , sophia are tear - jerkingly realistic and intimate ( probably due to the fact that they were a soon - to - be real - life couple ) . the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there 's very little chance of you guessing the ending . however , ends are tied up towards the end , leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness , shock and empathy for david aames . the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout . this is n't that hard because chances are that you 'll be completely drawn in to the film and wo n't take your eyes off the screen for one second . i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch . but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it . i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple , shallow films .

( airplane ! , naked gun . )  the jokes are indeed that bad .  but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you , they take themselves seriously .  how dare they !  godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes .  at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh .  each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them .  emmerich did do one thing , though .   ( and i've no idea if it was intentional . )  he made me sympathize with godzilla .  his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry for him being pelted with bullets and missles .  but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced .

525	we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
526	a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . "  dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .

537	this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree .  although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers .  it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one .  `a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why .  ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable .  evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well .  here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season :  1 ) period detail .  this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail .  shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .  shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .  on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .  director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .  i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .  2 ) mom and dad .  both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles .  it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured .  for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .  in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .  his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment .  which brings us to . . . .  3 ) the comic situations .  there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' .  moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish .  i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard .  again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .  the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .  i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .  not only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places .  i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition .  why don't you ?

544	pitch black is a sheep in wolf's clothing .  it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience .  don't be fooled .  pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest .  it starts off with blistering intensity .  a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns .  among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely .  there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film .  there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal .  and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who's being brought back to justice by johns .  the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other .  confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment .  those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet's wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh .  fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet's surface .  unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters .  the group's savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory .  or does it ?  pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock " escape the boogieman " conflicts the genre typically serves up .  just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false .  the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth .  a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations .  i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist .  conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah .  one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed .  imam is forced to reassess his faith .  another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate .  yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group .  it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick .  special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence .  his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick .  they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth .  the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked .  the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien .  the dialogue isn't the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book .  yes , the appearance of riddick's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation .  these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell .  twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .

554	the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane .  billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble .  christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books .  he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports .  jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus .  and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases .  the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium .  during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan .  the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast .  the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another .  henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game .  the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other .  michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity .  as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh .  although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing .  while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special .  lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance .  his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character .  lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character .  the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise .  the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot .  
555	poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
556	at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film .  now my view has completely changed .  it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride .  the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention .  they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) .  of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves .  thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians .  the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse .  i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny .  all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series .  one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series .  creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death .  a person can only take so much .  we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it .  it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful .  it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful .  speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well .  sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked .  it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage .  it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is .  alan rickman however was not so lucky .  after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess .  it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away .  when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up .  like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results .  times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk .  when will it stop ?  i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash .  it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story .  is that too much to ask ?  obviously it is .  when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands .  aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre .  it's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining .  the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .  
557	it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
558	the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
559	there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
560	when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times .  such was the case with frequency .  every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview .  it looked awful .  it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous .  it looked like a flop .  well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far .  frequency boasts a compelling story line .  an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years .  john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes .  somehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . .  including john's mother .  this is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) .  with all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction .  also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending .  frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying .  hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up .  now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency .  but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved .  who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ?  is it because we've become accustomed to time travel " laws " from other places like " star trek " and the back to the future trilogy and " quantum leap " ?  yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense .  most films are like that .  don't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however .  when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) .  when you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share .  it's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work .  [pg-13]  
561	the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
562	coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels .  relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work .  divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases .  to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation .  fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies .  they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives .  this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content .  the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best .  useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be .  the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career .  signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast .  but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway .  
563	the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .  doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .  it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive .  his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster .  and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .  williams is the title character , hunter " patch " adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .  we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .  it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .  he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade .  his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board .  the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense .  although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .  at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity .  the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why .  monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .  for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .  the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way .  the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid .  director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring .  patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time .  nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season .  it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place .  by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family .

566	wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy .  there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group .  this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core .  wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 .  i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch .  wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story .  what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists .  everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie .  the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it .  using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once .  that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner .  the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex .  both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected .  nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? .  the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat .  the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound .  theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad " no nudity " clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) .  the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower .  maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs .  kevin bacon ) is familiar with .  the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life .  that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script .  it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker .  but i suppose we all need to put food on the table .  mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) .  quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws .  the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school .  a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him .  one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn .  after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) .  they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale .  meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help .  the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with .  this is definitely not a character- based motion picture .  not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth .  the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more .  matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps .  neve campbell gets to model the slutty look .  denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit .  and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon .  the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) .  columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ?  wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by .  thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing .  but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .

568	the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright .  directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth .  and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble .  jeez .  after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy .  they hire the world's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem .  that's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn't it ?  the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times .  i was not alone .  plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents .  the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots .  the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact .  producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .  
569	this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
570	while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
571	 " you've got mail " is the very definition of a " cute " movie .  it's got cute stars , a cute story-line , and even cute pets .  despite this over-whelming cuteness ( or maybe because of it ) , i loved " you've got mail " .  i know , i know .  i'm supposed to be a film critic .  i'm not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this .  but darn it , somewhere along the way , " you've got mail " reeled me in , hook , line , and sinker .  the movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends , without ever knowing each others identity .  as the movie progresses , though , they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other .  meanwhile , in " real-life " , they are bitter competitors .  she owns a quaint little children's bookstore , he owns one of those gigantic super-bookstores that offer impersonal service and discount prices .  while his store threatens to run her store out of business , their online relationship grows stronger .   " you've got mail " is as artificial as movies come .  everything is nice and happy and by the end , all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life .  there are no real conflicts , no major disappointments , no unresolved issues .  nevertheless , i quite enjoyed it .  in fact , i can't remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies .  i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it .  the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either .  in particular , hanks is at his best here , turning his " charm-meter " up to 11 .  everytime he was on screen , he had my full attention .  and despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business , i was rooting for him .  it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman .   " you've got mail " certainly won't be winning any awards , but as an exercise in pure entertainment , it's as good as it gets .  
572	a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .  1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big " breakthrough " role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .  as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .  not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .  as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .  the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .  however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .  and to my surprise , it grew on me .  the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .  see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .  also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .  carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .  for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .  perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .  and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's " somebody to love " , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .  the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .  i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .  also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .  still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .  or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . )  hell , that's what i do every day .

575	believability wasn't one of the film's virtues . 
576	warning : may contain slight mild spoilers .  rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language .  starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne .  running time : 132 minutes  we go into a movie theater , boom !  the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on .  we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is .  why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into .  again like this past summers hit " stigmata " , " end of days " may be worse .  it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some " rosemary's baby " , along with " the devil's advocate " a little " exorcist " and some " stigmata " here and there .  whala you have " end of days " a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific .  sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers .  the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next .  jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist .  he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes .  he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie .  that's pretty much it on plot .  it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went .  as for arnie ?  good role , ok performance .  i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts .  the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film .  in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions .  gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in " stigmata " ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character .  two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun " the devil's advocate " and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also .  robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child .  of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new .  the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in " stigmata " .  here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie .  the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home .  only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well .  the sad thing is that " end of days " had so many things going for it .  the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing .  at times it seems like " armageddon " and started to get old and tiresome .  hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones .  even with its 100m budget " end of days " is less than pleasing .  in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget .  maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original .  we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office .  we need to get more films like " the blair witch project " that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch .  overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm  yup those pretty much describe " end of days " .

581	i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films .  when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing .  but it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron's whiny views of life and romance .  tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively .  baldwin's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse .  jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems .  sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out .  ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it .  annie is a happy woman .  she is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content .  but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it .  five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet .  at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity .  here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five .  the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory .  sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell .  but none of them can save the film from being a bore .  its characters are dull and empty , its script isn't funny or particularly charming .  the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue " sleepless in seattle , " whom she has never even seen .  it's the kind of life decision that real people don't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice .  in essence , this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist .  it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler .  if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it , you could just call me " asleep in philadelphia .

" wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .  in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .  so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .  the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it's still pretty boring .  will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .  west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .  talk about deeply developed characters .  at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .  the year is 1869 .  several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .  president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .  there's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .  west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .  as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .  i'd go further with the plot , but there isn't any point .  this film's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .  i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .  there isn't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that's pretty disasterous when you consider that it's primarily a comedy .  as i said , the fault is totally that of the script .  when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .  the leads could've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would've been awful .  no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! "  sound good .  still , this film has a lot going for it visually .  the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .  the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning .  he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .  i won't fault barry sonnenfeld either .  he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .  despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half-way point .  the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .  if " wild wild west " didn't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .  as it is , it's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .  it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .  
586	this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman recruit . she brings her way of dealing with the law , which means more than simple convictions . the strong performance of the main character , supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable .

589	i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's " the company of wolves , " to 1992's " the crying game , " and 1994's " interview with a vampire . "  his latest film , " the butcher boy , " is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming .  told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life .  his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore .  francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder .  the premise of , " the butcher boy , " is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works .  francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him .  this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well .  the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .  the supporting characters are no help , though .  rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter .  he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout .  shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her .  and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice .  the pacing is all off in , " the butcher boy . "  although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while .  it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs .  at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it .  i'd rather think of , " the butcher boy , " as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire .  he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film .  what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore .  
590	i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy .  boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment !  after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater !  read on to see what i have to say . . . .  four rooms :  starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye .  possible stars )   " four rooms " was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year .  key word here : " supposed . "  four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast .  i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great .  the plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job .  he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems .  tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script .  it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy .  anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them .  the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot .  this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife .  the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite .  the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger .  the movie was just plain trash .  there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film .  it was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film .  tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film .  the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals .  marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role .  this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat " plaza suite , " but it wasn't .  as trashy as it was , some people will call it classic .  do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna's chest showing a classic film ?  look for more of ken's kritic korner coming soon !  please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews .  p . s .

591	i first read pearl s buck 's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class , and i enjoyed every thrilling page of it . it was almost inevitable that hollywood would get hold of it , and considering that it was made in 1937 , the results are excellent . certain things have to be accepted : in 1937 there was no question of casting asian actors in a major hollywood film . in a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic - looking cast . with that obstacle to overcome , executive producer irving thalberg and director sidney franklin ( among others ) took the trouble to hand - pick a splendid and stellar cast . paul muni plays wang lung . muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period , and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to . once you get past the makeup ( it 's good , but no one is going to really mistake him for a chinese man ) , his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work . then there is luise rainer . coming off an oscar win the previous year for her performance in the great ziegfeld , the viennese actress 's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of o - lan despite her lack of experience in hollywood . her performance won her a second consecutive oscar , the first time in history that happened . much criticism has been leveled at rainer 's performance , and her oscar win here . she has been called wooden and one - note . there is a small grain of truth in that . however , that being said , all you need to do is go back to the book . for rainer , though not chinese , played o - lan pretty much as buck wrote her ; it is in fact a splendid performance , and one of the best transfers from book to screen i have ever witnessed . as for the rest of the cast , well this was mgm . they had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in hollywood at the time , and a big budget to pay for the best , and in the end they got the best . the film softens wang lung 's marriage to o - lan somewhat . in the novel , with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine , a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him . in the film , a contrite wang lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before , realizing too late that she was his true love . corny , yes . but that 's hollywood . considering the obstacles they were up against , the film might well have opened to screams of laughter . but despite the noticeable dearth of real asians in the cast , this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy - three years . in fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is , when it might so easily have been a disaster .
592	this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '

596	warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career .  based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system .  beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown .  after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . )  instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him .  however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin .  and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . )  it's remarkable that this film was released at all .  much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name .  the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true .  it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject .  talking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun .  and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed .  even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor .   ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . )  the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . )  and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed .  it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself .  second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps .  halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator .  also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun .  and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself .  the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par .  the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well .  the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever .  they're not cringe inducing , at least .  the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system .  best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining .  there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes .  bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws .  perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant .  in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected .  bulworth , then , is well worth watching .  a david wilcock review ? 1999   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes

608	 " my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me " says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) .  take his advice !  to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace .  and to watch this film is almost as painful .   " get carter " is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy .  jack carter is as tough as tough guys come .  he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster' .  explaining his duties , he says , " people make promises and break them .  i help them remember . "  he has a chiseled body full of tattoos .  he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times .  he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice .  in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester  stallone .  and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice .  with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows .  yet , even tough guys know when to put family first .  as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident .  the police attribute it to heavy drinking .  however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out' .  he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth .  as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters .  they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website .  any one of them may know something about his brother's death .  all of them have the means of carrying out the deed .  but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth .  he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation .  instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects .  flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again .  this all gets tiring fairly quickly .  by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace .  oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action .  admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) .  the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion .  stallone has the personality of a slab of stone .  and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast .  the weather is constantly overcast or rainy .  meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys .  it's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere .  as a result , " get carter " amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement .  you're better off leaving this guy alone .

616	jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun .  his latest film , " knock off , " skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless .  you can't really blame van damme .  no one , i suspect , has ever expected " the muscles from brussels " to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray .  and even his sidekick co-star , " saturday night live " alumnus rob " makin' copies " schneider , does what's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man .  no , the problem with the film is its direction .  the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . .  and it goes downhill from there !  five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes .  van damme doesn't land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess .  director hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed " double team , " films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard to know what's going on , who's on whose side , and what the point of all this is .  faster than you can yell " fruit stand ! "  we're watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme .  when schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing " move your beautiful big ass , " the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre .  every now and again " knock off " will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they're wasted .  if only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute .  if you're interested in the plot , you're better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : " jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with " nanobombs " hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs .  maybe .  with paul sorvino . "  a more accurate summary would be " jean-claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large , blatant coca-cola product placements . "  the fact that the film is staged during hong kong's last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn't figure in at all .  perhaps " knock off " 's most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score .  some of you might remember the mael brothers as the '80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- " kimono my house " indeed !  like the cheap jeans and " pumma " sneakers manufactured in hong kong , van damme's latest is a real phony .

618	one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes they're not .  but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .  it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .  murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .  the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .  i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .

652	capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .  joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .  it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .  the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .  i had a good time .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  here goes my credibility .  this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .  i liked the third jurassic park film .  i even liked the second jurassic park film .  in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle .  jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , " for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . "  that is what all the jurassic park films are .  expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .  the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .  jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .  the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .  some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .  that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .  i feel i got my money's worth .  the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .  this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .  they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height .  the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not .  the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .  flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .  he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .  but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .  doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .  they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .  he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .  right .  guess what happens next ?  jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .  first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .  sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first .  curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .  one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .  they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .  of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species .  not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic .  in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .  this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .  each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course .  in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty .  it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .  perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .  sometimes they just move too fast to see .  occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .  a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory .  but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .  the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .  joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .  a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .  the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun .  if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

660	summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money .  wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies .  will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses .  he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing .  west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . )  before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives .  there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough .  there's also a pleasant soundtrack .  buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes .  and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see .  apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works .  firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money .  one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise .  both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end .  not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy .  therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious .  the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing .  she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith .  her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character .  the 'humour' in the film is also very off .  will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display .  the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk .  it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself .  it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably .  the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness .  there's also problems with the plot .  jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill .  plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly .  the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built .  why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ?  director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair .  wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more .  it's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .  
661	schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
662	most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like " toy story 2 " does .  far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little .  is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?  thankfully , " toy story 2 " is a wonderful exception .  i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one .  it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind " toy story " and " a bug's life , " is still at the top of its game .  woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit " toy story , " and things have changed a bit since the last one ended .  woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp .  in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge .  unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) .  off to save him are buzz and members of the old " toy gang , " including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) .  while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled " woody's roundup . "  he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse .  they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever .  this means woody now faces a difficult choice .  with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ?  as in the original film , " toy story 2 " contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there .  reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters .  the film is well worth seeing on the big screen .  the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more " human . "  the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable .  there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor .  pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it .  the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development .  tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice .  it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim .  all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent .  several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work .   " toy story 2 " is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie .  woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like .  the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner .  it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching .  the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel .  the reason " toy story 2 " works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters .  not this one .  we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up .   " toy story 2 " is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself .  there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here .  the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults .  there are funny asides to films such as " star wars " and " jurassic park , " among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts " a bug's life " and the 1997 short " geri 's game . "   ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . )  the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better .   " toy story 2 " never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest .  the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is .  it's rare to see a film like " toy story 2 " come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike .  it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile .  it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing " toy story 2 . " it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .

666	has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs ?  in enemy of the state , that is exactly right .  a few parts the net , and a few parts conspiracy theory , enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997's lame brained men in black .  will this guy ever get a real role ?  he has the bruce willis syndrome .  the plot is bascially smith , playing a lawyer , getting into hot water with some high government murderers , who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie , when a tape of the killing gets into his hands .  he inlists the help of an old conspirator ( hackman ) , and , at the end , er . . . you  know .  enemy was one of the worst films of last year .  not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight , the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven , and i didn't like how smith always magically out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters , seeming more intelligent than smith , somehow got run over by a truck .  enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek : insurrection .  i know these two films are different in , well , everything , but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me .  somehow , quality can't overshadow quantity .

681	starship troopers is a bad movie .  i mean , a really , really , bad movie .  not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .  looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .  that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .  the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .  as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .  eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .  as our faster than light travelling " heroes " arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .   " what ? "  you say , " laser beam weapons ?  sonic weapons ?  phasers ?  photon cannons ? " .  nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !  i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .  as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .  two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .  this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .  again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !  in the end , we see neil patrick " doogie howser " harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .  he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !  this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .  i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway .  i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .  in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .  copyright ( c ) 1997 tim jandt " >

689	i saw this film opening weekend in australia , anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger , edgerton , bloom , watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me . unfortunately , despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role , the plot was paper thin .... which does n't inspire me to read " our sunshine " . there were some other plus points , the support acting from edgerton in particular , assured direction from jordan ( confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well ) , and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush , much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it . but i ca n't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero ( or was he?) .... in what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us . oh well , at least jordan and the producers did n't agree to lose the beards just to please universal ... guess i will just have to content myself with peter carey 's excellent " secret history of the kelly gang " . 4/10

694	kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv - adaptation of jane austen´s novel . when i read that novel i was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story : for honestly , she is so terribly self - righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously . kate beckinsale´s interpretation , however , saves emma from herself so to speak : she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view , and one can´t help but give in and like ( not to say love ) her in spite of her less amiable qualities . kate beckinsale is the main , but not the only , reason why this tv - series is so delightful ; raymond coulthard is perfect as mr. frank churchill , expressing this character´s personal magnetism to the full ( which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of emma ) , and mark strong , samantha morton , bernard hepton , and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles . this production is , in short , a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure .

706	there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 - 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since . given the very low average rating given to the film by other people , i think you may draw your own conclusions . this is a very bad film . i 'll admit it , i thought the concept was kind of cute , and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work , but it did n't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known . acting : the leads seemed competent enough , but everyone else ? terrible . plot : chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through . direction : non - existent . humour : did they really think people were going to laugh ? oh boy . eye candy : ok . there were some really beautiful women in this film . not just the three main female characters , but right across the board . it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they would n't notice how terrible everything else was . if so , they failed miserably . in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic . it was n't even close .
707	at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise .  its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power .  he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents .  given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge .  eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom .  along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell .  talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) .  fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) .  then , everything ends happily .  unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds .  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes .  never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly .  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia .  after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards .  wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ?  if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ?  and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ?  these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film .  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to " wait " , and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure .  even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work .  it just completely fails altogether miserably .  the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career .  the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is .  my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .  ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow .  to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million .  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right .  leonard maltin rightfully called it " second rate in scripting , and acting " and at-a-glance film reviews called it " a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore " .  i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about .  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer .  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing .  in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time .  
708	buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .  gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .  once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .  the truth is he isn't married .  to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .  the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film .  buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .  gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .  the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .  gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house .  ricci's performance during the scene at gallo's parent's home are very well done .  there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .  the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .  they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine .  gallo's character is developed very well .  the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .  gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .  his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .  this character seemed very realistic to me .  ricci's character is funny and different .  she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !  ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves .  buffalo ? 66 isn't all laughs though .  many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .  gallo's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .  some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .  the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .  i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .  overall , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some people put it up to be .  the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .

712	set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster " families " go to war over control of " the numbers " , an illegal gambling lottery .   " runners " take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings .  the undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum .  by turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace .  the queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth " bumpy " johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her .  he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion .  bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch .  bloody gang warfare ensues .  bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign .  his new army questions his methods .  his girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions .  most importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him .  there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it .  this movie is not original at all .  in fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather .  if you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) .  how could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ?  here are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) .  crooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader .  gang extracts revenge on crooked cop .  wife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him .  high ranking " officer " betrays the leader .  blood relative of the leader murdered .  war erupting between the " families " .  high-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members .  new leader runs family differently from previous leader .  large meeting with all families involved .  the setup in this movie is done rather well .  i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of " runners " sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery .  this was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table .  number running was the only way for the harlem population to find work .  i also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky .  after about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) .  it was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence .  who was the screenwriter kidding here ?  some of the individual performances were well done .  andy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role .  tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in " the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover " and " rob roy " .  the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows .  a couple of coincidences is one thing , over a dozen is an insult .  directed by bill duke  ellsworth bumpy johnson . . . . . . . lawrence  fishburne dutch schultz . . . . . . . . . . . . tim  roth lucky luciano . . . . . . . . . . andy  garcia the queen . . . . . . . . . . . . . cicely tyson francine hughes . . . . . . . . . . vanessa  l . williams illinois gordon . . . . . . . . . . chi  mcbride  written by randy turgeon , january 22 , 1998

718	bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one .  the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner .  anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration .  the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one .  bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so .  a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye .  after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie .  but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project .  kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film .  after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge .  the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage .  the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him .  when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes .  these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse .  bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen .  certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny .  no , hilarious .  standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) .  and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas .  while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles .  masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script .  however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy .  this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's .  murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well .  these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs .  steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it .  this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules .  but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season .  the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits .  the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top .  graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay .  i wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough .  
719	 . . . an inviting piece of film . 
720	 " spawn " may be somewhat of an older film .  in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) .  but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing .  it wasn't the worst film of year by any means .  it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year .  but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my " worst of 1997 " list .  the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year .  performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy .  in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !  even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality .  i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed .   .   .  well , annoyingly unprofessional .  john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite .  he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional .  but the main problem i found with " spawn " , as with most films that wind up on my " worst of " lists , is that it was just plain boring .  i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film .  sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion .  never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way .  even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again .  like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small .  i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me .  and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created .  but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game .  who knows if " spawn : the video game " wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ?  keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all .  but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission .  this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing .  if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be !  trust me !   " spawn " has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers !

737	okay , first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie . so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion . first off , bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century . if that 's what you 're looking for go somewhere else . just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy . it 's supposed to make you feel good and you 're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished . secondly , the acting though not " halle berry in monster 's ball " is still good . the movie does n't need acting like that honestly so do n't look for it . it 's a family movie . if that 's what you wanted you would n't or should n't even be looking into this movie honestly . lastly , it has a really cute story . i think it 's thought out well and it 's entertaining to watch . it 's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you 're finished . if you 're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you . -lyndsay
738	although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
739	sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it .  it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .  i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .  the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .  of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film .  disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous .  it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .  it's a suspense film with no suspense .  it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of .  it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits .  our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden .  he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself .  steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally .  the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends .  marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .  as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) .  gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people .  so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it .  by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense .  disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg .  i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting .  he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .  evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .  rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .  and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally " explained . "  there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening .  they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures .  the doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) .  much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act .  in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .  up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .  that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown .  for instance , he points to the " nerds , " who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .  it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered .  most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , " bite me ! "  anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .  this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy .  the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry .  horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid .  there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .  i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler .  he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking .  the acting is largely a waste of talent .  marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .  bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .  stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .  none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool .  disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .  i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .  it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film .  it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable .  so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .

742	my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled " dragnet " reruns off the air .  sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv .  even though " dragnet " is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous " blue boy " episode of " dragnet . "  for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i .  as what would happen if sgt .  joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic .  in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth .  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters .  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up .  the " produced and directed by jack webb " card pretty much goes without saying .  this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot .  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i .  gives us more -- much more .  webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up .  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will " personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . "   ( whether the " lace panties " part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . )  this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell .  for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his .  i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . .   " now you listen to me , youngster .  someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . .  i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . "  i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i .   ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) .  he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i .  webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , " just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? "  bogart he ain't .  the other d . i .  gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , " he's a damn good d . i .   . . .  i guess i'm just a little jealous . "  join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display .   " you expect me to talk to you . . .  in _here_ ? ! " he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras .  the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen .  a little girl spots him in the store and demands , " what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? "  he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , " what an odd species of human -- so small .  must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . "  this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for .  the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills .  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , " was that flea you killed a male or female ? "  owens replies , " a male , sir . "  webb yells to the platoon , " this ain't the one ! "  that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment .  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century .  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines .  someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did .  it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself .  there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter .  webb bursts in the room and shouts , " what did i tell you about laughing ? ! "  to which the private replies , " sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! "  and let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie .

746	when 17 year old beau hall ( jonathan tucker , " the virgin suicides " ) gets in a car accident after drinking with his 30 year old companion , club owner darby reese ( josh lucas , " session 9 " ) , his mom , margaret ( tilda swinton , " the war zone " ) pays reese a visit to convince him to leave her son alone .  instead , reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese .  the next morning margaret discovers darby's dead body on their beach and , suspecting the worst , weights it down in a distant part of the lake .  but her troubles are just beginning , as she soon learns with the arrival of blackmailer alek spera ( goran visnjic , " practical magic " ) in " the deep end . "  the incredibly pale , red-headed scottish actress swinton immerses herself into the role of the reserved american super-mom whose life revolves around serving the needs of her three children and live-in father-in-law jack ( peter donat , " the game " ) .  she shows great strength while allowing other emotions to glimmer through - discomfort at challenging reese in his gay disco ( named the deep end ) , near panic at having to dive down to his body to retrieve car keys , or even wry humor when an attempt to get help from jack becomes hopelessly miscommunicated .  gradually her loneliness becomes apparent ( her husband's a naval officer , usually away at sea ) when her attempts to email him her concerns about beau are deleted and later , when a most unusual , yet chaste , romance turns tragic .  it's a terrific performance .  the stendahl syndrome-like script , adapted from elisabeth sanxay holding's 40's noir novel 'the blank wall' by directors scott mcgehee and david siegel , would be unbelievable if not for swinton and her costar visnjic .  alek spera is a wrong side of the tracks loser who arrives after reese's body has been discovered .  he shows margaret a videotape of beau having sex with reese and demands $50 , 000 or he'll turn the tape over to the reno police .  subsequent visits will turn his mind set upside down and backwards , though , as he comes to admire and even love the woman he set out to blackmail .  there's yet another problem , though - his partner nagle ( raymond barry , " dead man walking " ) is a harder cored criminal who won't let up until his share of the money is delivered .  visnjic's dark , brooding turn has an interior shading to it that makes us believe he's a victim of circumstance and environment .  his turnaround is palpable as he witnesses margaret's inherent decency and her workaday surroundings .  also outstanding is tucker as beau , who has a terrific character arc and pas de deux with his mother .  initially beau's the typical sullen teen .  'you're blowing this out of proportion , ' he says of her concerns about reese , not comprehending that his mom has enough insight to have divined the true nature of the relationship .  as his mom gets in deeper and deeper trying to cover up a crime he didn't commit , beau becomes suspicious of her actions and apparent new companion , turning tables .  his early black eye becomes her later split lip .  while the two can never be completely honest with each other , their love for each other comes through strongly .  the directors ( " suture " ) have a firm grip on their material and cast .  the story builds perfectly with bold strokes amidst a myriad of subtler underpinnings .  water imagery is constant ( an early shot of weirdly rushing green is revealed to be a young boy cleaning out an aquarium ) .  giles nuttgens ( " fire " ) cinematography , which won the 2001 sundance festival award , is crisp and startlingly clear .  the tahoe locations and production design by kelly mcgehee and christopher tandon provide a dual personality for the film , contrasting the calm , well off existence of the lake against the gambling city of reno .   " the deep end " is a complex story of domino deeds and shifting relationships .  take the plunge .  
747	with stars like sigourney weaver ( " alien " trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot .  sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller .  helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak .  incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes .  a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco .  detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first .  copycat " borrows " a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work .  but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . .  much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama .  even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . .  weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) .  harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter .  which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) .  copycat is a good thriller .  although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move .  this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts .  nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .  
748	i first saw this video 15 years ago . i thought it was excellent then and i still do . i am a former teacher of english ( high school and college ) and a lover of english romantic poetry , so coleridge rates highly with me . anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would n't get my vote of excellence . in this case , everything works well to engage the viewer , especially high school students . the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television . in addition , the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it . okay , so there was n't a big budget for the project . so it was n't star wars and there 's no cgi in it . but who can dismiss gustave doré illustrations as part of the presentation ? the comment above , which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash , is grossly unfair and unperceptive . i 'm a friend of the producer , but that is n't my reason for this comment . rather , i 'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels . it is well suited to bring coleridge 's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts .
749	this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
750	what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
751	in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural " rush hour " - to the tune of about $250 million .  you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in " rush hour 2 . "  the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in " rush hour " that played well to audiences around the world .  the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable .  i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations .  surprisingly , " rush hour 2 " wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it .  the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start .  terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime .  concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights .  instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars .  the makers of " rush hour 2 " are working at a distinct advantage over the original .  we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around .  that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit .  little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in " rush hour . "  first and foremost to me , in " rh2 , " is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography .  the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint .  chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket .  his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino .  like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch .  chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys .  when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun .  when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff .  the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills .  the combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the " lethal weapon " films .  the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently .  john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) .  lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to " get lee and carter , " but gives the chief bad guy elegance .  zhang zi-yi ( " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter .   ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . )  roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch .  director ratner and the original " rush hour " production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera .  cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives " rh2 " the fluid camera movement the genre film needs .  production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino .  the rest of the techs are of the same high quality .  i'm surprised to even say that " rush hour 2 " is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies .  it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer .  i give it a b .  
752	marie : you are smooth . dan : no , i 'm not smooth . i 'm dan . if you 're anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . you see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you do n't . or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you 've ever said in your life . more often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk . you ca n't blame a guy for being a little frightened though . maybe he 's been burned hard before or maybe he 's trying to focus all his energy on his career . there are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . you tell yourself you do n't need it or it is n't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . any way you break it down , it 's not easy . sound familiar ? if you thought yes even just a little , then dan in real life , the new comedy from director peter hedges , is a must - see . it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once . the dan from the title is dan burns ( steve carell ) , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . after that tragedy , dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of dan 's priorities . and so he became more functional than feeling . removed from the power of intimacy , dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . that is , until he meets marie ( juliette binoche ) in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning . they 're interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off guard . there is only one problem really . she is already seeing someone . unfortunately for all involved , that someone is dan 's brother , mitch ( dane cook ) . his entire family has come up to their parents ' country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning . it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan 's heart from its coma . with so many family members to deal with ( jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm ) , dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan , hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . luckily , hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden . it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes ( despite the occasional evan almighty - sized misstep ) . he is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humorist . as dan , he is also self - deprecating , awkward and scared . carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as dan . whether he 's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time . i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did , despite its slight shortcomings ( juliette binoche  i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i do n't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved ) , because of where i am in my life . would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? i ca n't say . what i can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
753	paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils .  starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage .  it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one .  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) .  i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 .  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics .  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience .  there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him .  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic .  it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir .  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on .  but why ?  his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster .  the kind who just won't die .  hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( " i've lost cohesion again ! " ) .  they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e .  bush referring to clinton ; " ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ?  to what end ? " --  this actually got applause !  suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) .  the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ?  ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ?  as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) .  they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself .  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead .  our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? )  begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger .  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow .  like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than " audiences will pay for anything these days " .  it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride .  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care .  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick .  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ?  a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability .  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot .  but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway .  verhoeven delivers the sleazy " goods " , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable .  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background .  it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well .  it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand .  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks .  in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat .  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked .  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy .  it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses .   " are you looking at me ? " , she queries , obviously haunted .  it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) .  those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer .  and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental .  you've been warned .  but you probably won't listen , will you ?  tis' a pity ? ? ?

757	as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me .   " mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie .  director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . "  that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie .  in " mimic " , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original .  the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . "  the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies .  there's nothing new in " mimic " .  it's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work .  at the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back .  maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on .  i don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas .  watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on !  the switch is to your right !  use common sense !  just do it !  you'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "  there's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off .  it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts .   " hmmm . . . .  i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . "   " mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo !  just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you .  the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too .  i shouldn't blame del toro .  he isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie .  hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . "  french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies .  robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . "  i don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie .  woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films .  i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america !  i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long .  do you speak english ?  now , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here .  just remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine .  they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up .  if you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time .

758	omigosh , this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever , ever seen . to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement , and i have seen heaps ( considering the limited availability in new zealand , that 's quite a lot ) , but never before have i had to sleep with the light on ... until i saw the grudge . some may say that it is a rip off of the ring ( both based on japanese horror movies ) , both similar ( yet different ) story lines , but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema , i even screamed at a certain point in the movie . the acting is great , particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show , she is such an enthusiastic person . jason behr is a real hottie , and william mapother looks like he is having fun . however , while i am normally a fan of clea duvall 's , she does n't really seem into this movie . of the supporting characters , hers probably got the most depth and back story , but she does n't seem like she is all there . as for sarah michelle gellar , well , she stays about the same through all her films and roles does n't she ? the ghosts were genuinely scary , the music and sound effects were chilling ( particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland 's character answered the phone in her apartment ) , the ending was cool too . super highly recommended . 9/10

"  okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie .  disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship .  father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson .  it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack .  before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard .  against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own .  tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild .  much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his " father , " which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts .  all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults .  when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end .  look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend .  growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends .  one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) .  both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .  i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films .  just fill in the blanks !  can you see it ?   " now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it .  we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have  we had an ape and an elephant yet ?  well , there we go ! "  of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through .  together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa .  she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory " you tarzan , me jane " scene .  thankfully , those aren't the exact words .  however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction .  how does he tell his name to another ape ?   " ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "  well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable .  but hey , tarzan's a young adult .  do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ?  isn't that illegal in most countries ?  oh , well .  i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore .  tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .  there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time .  we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material .  this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different .  do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie .  with each new feature , disney animation gets even better .  not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .  there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying .  the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's " extreme tarzan . "  however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its " chandelier scene , " which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking .  lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail .  as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters .  the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell .  going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately .  her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , " that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . "  distracting to say the least .  i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan of the apes , " so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book .  but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film .  with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us .  note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature .  this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .  'nuff said .

773	synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does .  the story is told from harry's point of view .  harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink .  one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke .  seduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man .  turns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post .  when the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail .  harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money .  can he get out of this mess ?  opinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel .  hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence .  this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof .  but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction .  there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs .  even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground .  towards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession .  if you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels .

776	it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar .  why ?  the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' .  i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' .  but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster .  this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel .  you have been warned .  of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation .  brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off .  when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) .  of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . .  all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood .  that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient .  if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole .  sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration .  the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) .  after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet .  suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction .  for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art .  the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive .  immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars .  let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there .  it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months .  i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia .  instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship .  what happened during the five months prior to this ?  did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ?  still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak .  depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ?  c'mon ) .  there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud .  it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists .  as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . .  maybe even cheated .  after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen .  others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . '  okay , it did suck .  but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . .  after all , they do pretty well .  sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) .  the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive .  so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ?  looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .  while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off .

787	come on hollywood , surprise me .  stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset .  the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls .  personal , because his niece is one of the victims .  it's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist .  freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl .  we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to " dominate " these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem .  anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well ,  you know the rest .  a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story .  perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue .  so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ?  and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh  please !  kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass .  maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here .  one , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting .  two , the script has no sense of humour .  three , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea .  thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story .  we can't feel her rage .  some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register .  and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this .  for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying .  young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead .  but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ?  not much , and you can hardly blame him .  there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling .  but the script is beyond rescue .  what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up .  complacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue .  the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . .   .

793	you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade .  two people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities .  nora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence .  ephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple .  ryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) .  their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots .  for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn .  yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan .  and the two are kept busy .  one , the other or both are in nearly every scene .  hanks has his decent guy routine down pat , yet each time he does it , it seems effortless , spontaneous and fresh .  ryan smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable , with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew .  their scenes together sparkle , even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle .  and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you've got mail like dried-up mistletoe .  the sparks created by the earlier movie are , by necessity , not evident here .  true , these are two people seeking true love , but you've got mail is more comic and less poignant than its predecessor .  the ephrons' script is witty and sharp .  however , as a director nora ephron is a bit uneven .  some scenes drag , while others , especially when hanks and ryan are revealing their souls via e-mail , are crisp and tidy .  also , the script gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing from the story .  a nice , romantic soundtrack adds to this date-night special .  overall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads .  it's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
794	this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle .  tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far .  badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves .  i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie .  furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence .  and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production .  of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line .  imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like .  with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse .  anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect .  the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) .  the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough .  instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) .  he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble .  meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization .  on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals .  one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help .  with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born .  its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability .  with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal .  his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off .  jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her .  some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover .  since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency .  tarzan continues this trend .  march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act .  meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy .  instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance .  the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies .  the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless .  the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance .  the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) .  and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals .  over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material .  the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) .  weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number .  and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 .

797	`we run tings .  tings don't run we . '  -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) .  jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .  capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .  when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .  capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .  torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .  directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .  shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are .  the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .  the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .  the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest .  paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .  mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .  unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .  the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .  the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .  oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .  at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) .  palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .  chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record .  overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .  if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film .  the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .  i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .

802	go's is a gloriously slick hip machine .  director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .  after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending .  this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive .  a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .  the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough .  her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas .  zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust .  perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ;  pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last .  torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier .  in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date .  here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you .  if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go .  but i digress .  go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride .  in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) .  i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous .  when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me .  yet entertain me it did .  go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs .  fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go .  unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

804	showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer .  their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie .  possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . .  and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it .  there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails .  the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls .  we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . .  but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner .  in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future .  this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity .  verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making .  his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze .  this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie .   ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . )  many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist .  it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power .  it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment .  an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value .  the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator .  if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation .  you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . .  and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing .  this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity .  showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness .  nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known .  she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be .  when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be .  gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life .  molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision .  gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her .  gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness .  her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi .  the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path .  it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality .  cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas .  nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of " stardom . "  the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist .  kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy .  glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective .  plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation .  plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie .  some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying .  this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well .  i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making .  but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u .  on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person .

809	susan granger's review of " bread and tulips " ( first look pictures )  in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice .  for the first time in years , rosalba's on her own when she's abandoned at a highway rest area .  although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing-supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she's never visited .  rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning .  to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) .  film-maker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle-aged , middle-class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles .  the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low-key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage-therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber-turned-private eye who's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " bread and tulips " is a beguiling , escapist 8 .  as the summer ends , it's a magical getaway for mature audiences . .  
810	i stopped watching lost at this episode because i thought ana - lucia and libby 's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . then i found out that they kept libby around just to die in the next episode ! gah ! i ca n't handle it . i liked this show for the first season , but it definitely declined in the second season , i found jack and locke 's little religious feud to be annoying . the deaths of rodriguez & watros ' characters was the final straw !   i give this episode a 4/10 , for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by alias legend j.j. abrams . i hope his series in the future will improve on this one .

814	'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment .  chris columbus , the director who gave you " mrs . doubtfire " , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point .  based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult .  starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children .  soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious .  andrew is interested in art and music , he " enjoys " making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions .  it shows out that because of a small failure in the " electrical circuits " and " positronic brain " andrew has accidentally gained a soul .  this makes him unique and his evil creators worried .  then mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do .  soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love .  this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction .  ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy .  what makes us human ?  the thoughts ?  the emotions ?  is it possible to become human ?  at what point can we say to a robot " now you are one of us " ?  these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach .  it is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously .  when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question " when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? " , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding .  andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it .  in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards .  further more , there are other annoying problems .  to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now .  this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task .  columbus is the first to have crossed that line .  the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort .  the world is simply frozen in time .  neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years .  mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes .  when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference .  i am not saying that everything should change .  it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion .  i suppose it's possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it's really hard .  robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way .  as always he does a decent job , as does sam neill .  but it doesn't really matter .  it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience .  pretty much like last year's " meet joe black " , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn't deserve .  great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten .  when isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical .  everything seemed possible .  now is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago .  for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's " 20 000 leagues under the sea " , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality .  let us hope that next year's " a . i . "  will be more rewarding .

833	if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you .  this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat .  and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness .  the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m .  inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million .  the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money .  what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( " i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! " ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel .  the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) .  various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city .  screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another .  the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is .  the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs .  without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans .  rat race's cast is first rate .  cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man " born without a personality . "  the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy .  along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane !  and ruthless people .  a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol .  this is a fun little feature .  the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it .  rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you .

" hedwig and the angry inch " is a gender-bending glam-rock spectacular packed with great songs .  stylistically , the hook-laden tunes are reminiscent of bowie , " bat out of hell " era meatloaf and " the rocky horror show , " without ever seeming like imitations .  as with " tommy , " " hedwig " tells a story of isolation , pain and defiance , but without the bloated feel of that beloved , but overrated rock opera .  writer-director-star john cameron mitchell and composer-lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner .  mitchell stars as hedwig , a singer from east berlin touring a chain of u . s . coffee shops with her pan-slavic band , the angry inch .  while the patrons of the run-down restaurants look on in shock , and sometimes horror , hedwig boldly tells the sad story of her life in song .  she was once a boy named hansel ( ben mayer-goodman ) , living with his mother ( alberta watson ) and listening to rock and roll on american armed forces radio .  life is an exercise in duality for hansel .  a wall splits his hometown into two parts .  mother describes love as the emotion that comes when you find your other half .  as hansel grows up , the duality becomes more pronounced .  after initially mistaking him for a girl , a gi from the states ( maurice dean wint ) falls in love with hansel and wants to marry him .  alas , hansel will never pass the mandatory physical .  mother helpfully suggests a sex change , but the operation goes bad , hence the references to " the angry inch " ( yes , i know this part is squirm-inducing , but stick with me - it's worth it ) .  several years later , mr . right is long gone and hansel becomes hedwig , decked out in a farrah fawcett-style wig and fronting a band made up of korean women .  hedwig finds a new love in tommy ( michael pitt ) , a beatific lad with a unique take on christianity .  but tommy does hedwig wrong , stealing her songs and becoming a superstar .  cut to the present .  tommy gnosis' stadium tour is thriving and hedwig is suing him .  despite warnings from her manager ( andrea martin ) that she could easily be labeled a stalker , hegwig and her new band , the angry inch , continue their coffee shop tour , shadowing the thief by playing whatever city he is in .  if this sounds like a bizarre premise for a rock musical , take a few seconds and consider the plotlines of " tommy " and " rocky horror . "  as hedwig , john cameron mitchell does a magnificent job taking a character that could have simply been a caricature or an icon and turning her into a compelling human being .  mitchell has world-class style and vocal chords to match .  even though the backstory is unusually strong , mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical .  everything is propelled by one terrific song after another and , trust me , these are full-fledged rock songs , not the over-processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals .  while mitchell remains in the center of the stage throughout the film , there is much of interest on the sidelines .  miriam shor does fine work as yitzhak , hedwig's lover and bandmate , conveying a great deal through expressions alone .  decked out in a bandanna and a surprisingly convincing beard , she makes a mighty attractive man .  as always , " sctv " veteran andrea martin is a welcome presence onscreen and michael pitt is beguiling as tommy , the angelic-appearing little rat .  artist emily hubley adds to the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm the eye while underlining the central themes of the musical .   " hedwig and the angry inch " surrounds a weird , funny and touching story with a knockout series of songs performed by an exceptional cast .  true originals do not come along very often ? don't let this slip out of town without seeing it .  
836	reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , " analyze this , " i asked myself , " how could this miss ? "  robert de niro ( " taxi driver , " " raging bull " ) , billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) , lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) , and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon's vacation " ) .  these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny .  unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times .  the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen .  middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well .  although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) .  in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won't even admit to having anxiety attacks .  ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death .  it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben's potentially happy life gets into danger .   " analyze this " has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time .  admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline .  since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot .  one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop .  coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow's throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down .  sure , kudrow's fellow " friend " jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in " office space , " but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston .  kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place .  chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character .  finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears .  too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal .  once " analyze this " approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben .  afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches .   " analyze this " proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn't up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air .  
837	very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb , but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it 's terrible . i would n't have minded if this had been an animated series- would 've been better that way i guess , but as a live - action show , it typifies the terms ' cheesy ' and ' campy ' . of which power rangers is . five multi- coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . the costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . the acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes jean- claude van damme , look as equally as good as bruce lee , which is an understatement in itself . in fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the ' nutcracker ' , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun - yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly . kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . and even though this version is set in america , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us , but rather in japan ; thus the somewhat ' fake ' fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version - only to be juxtaposed onto the us version . if you like this type of thing , then stick with sentai- the japanese equivalent .
838	a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings .  family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail .  still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love .  and after it , i still can't .  bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare .  only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion .  bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children .  dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) .  over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma .  the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality .  randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening .  his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible .  he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn .  paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy " mad about you " persona , but he does it well .  as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here .  matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible .  this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it .  modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad .  carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now .  bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another " dating in the 90s " movie .  when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not .  even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .  it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser .  even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children .  any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue .  it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough .  there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching .  bye bye love is a genuine shame .  
839	after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy .  this new film has been underrated for no reason .  it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films .  it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two .  the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some " unfinished " developments of some characters .  the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : " the only wealth in this world is children .  more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure " .  the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of " part ii " to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate .  michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling .  constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children .  the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church .  later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , " a check in the amount of $100 million . "  but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness .  sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin .  but god does not take payoffs .  the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican .  there is a moment in " godfather iii " where michael says : " all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal .  but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . "   .  visually this film is as spectacular as the first two .  gordon willis' rich cinematography , carmine copolla's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis' wonderful art direction could not be better .  but copolla's first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection .  the third installment has only the plot and visuals .  some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films .  the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional .  the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars .  andy garcia is powerful as sonny's son , strong , focused and loyal .  violence is natural to him .  he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was .  however both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless .  and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed .  the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films .  in the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger .  this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo's character was more developed .  many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary .  i disagree .  it is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family .  the first film showed some horrible results of corleone's life .  it showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times .  a man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him .  the third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael's life .  the life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed .  there is no turning back .  and no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely .  the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead .  here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven

841	the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
842	the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of " leila , " a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features .  although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers .  set in modern-day iran , " leila " begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) .  as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet .  earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child .  when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children .  nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) .  bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with .  leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing .  there are no easy answers to be found within " leila , " a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration .  almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .  maybe because " leila " is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .  leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances .  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply .  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .  although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .  these " small " moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer .  refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .  despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .  sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?  in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .  unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .  for all of its strong aspects , " leila " isn't a perfect film .  on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .  and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .  mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi .  despite these minor missteps , " leila " is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la .  the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return .  it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .

845	seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture]  do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ?  everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) .  that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways .  in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors .  these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out .  how they will all come together is the process the film deals with .  i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .  the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come .  we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent .  she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works .  maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed .  things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences .  this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug .  the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .  nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be .  once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .  when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling .  considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today .  and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .  the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead .  simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined .  the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle .  we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna .  and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .  i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film .  perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .  still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well :   ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment .  he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low .   ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . '   ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre .  it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . '   ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner .   ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations .  even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch .   ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) .   ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment .  in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all .   . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure !   ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , ' `clerks , ' `jackie brown , ' `pulp fiction , ' `true romance ; ' also by liman : `swingers']

859	 " there will be another , " the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ?  true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway .  the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world .  given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions .  of course , it doesn't .  stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death .  i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality .  in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind .  it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating .  city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully .  there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success .  in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings .   ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . )  so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup .  this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead .  perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face .  at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave .  he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film .  kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank .  tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress .  the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve .  iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film .  like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination .  in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand .  even the soundtrack is tired .  more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look .  critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se .  he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery .  his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie .  but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved .  who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ?  the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .

870	adam sandler isn't known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he's still a really funny guy .  most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out .  big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler's comic performance , and it's a miserable failure .  sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) .  as one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say " good-bye " to one another ; in addition , there's a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) .  there's a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny .

872	as i write the review for the new hanks/ryan romantic comedy you've got mail , i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet .  i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online .  and i wonder : is that so bad ?  well , the commercial part is .  as for the movie , well , as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan , i think i'll be okay .  to paraphrase james berardinelli , whose reviews i admire very much , tom hanks and meg ryan can act .  they are both wonderful , but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films , such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan , and his glorious triumph in philadelphia , i like him best when he's suitably obnoxious .  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he's going to get the girl : the only question is how ?  meg ryan , america's high school sweetheart , can act .  she's had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don't , get the movie-- fantastic ) .  but , i like her best when she's , well , perky .  she is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime .  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don't really know .  all i know is that i just like them both .  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist , and i'm not going to even try .  they're just really , really cute , sweet , and charming .  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle .  here , the setup is a little different .  kathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children's bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her .  she is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) .  she is also having an affair , of sorts .  you see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 .  they have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is .  ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) .  fox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children's bookseller named " shop around the corner " , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly .  every morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight " to the death ! ! " .  it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have .  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no " let's have sex tonight " mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness .  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .  hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan " hook up " , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .  you know it's going to happen , the question is now ?  thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .  it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good .  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .  he is , i believe , america's greatest actor .  does he show it here ?  nah .  but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan .  which is what this movie boils down to .  it's pure confection .  all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet .  there are some immense flaws , like pacing .  the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow .  once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow .  i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .  e-mail ?  when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using .  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history .  they just work together , and it's nice to see .  it gives you , well , a smile .  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake .  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .  i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed .  you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate .  movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that .  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night .  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .  hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world .  he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie .  it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist .  it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

879	out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .  though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough .  in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .  he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .  he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine .  valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .  he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 .  seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson .  he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party .  he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it .  what a mess .  i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .  the limey does exactly that .  the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .  there is no method to this movie's madness .  it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .  the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .  this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude .  i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck .  ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .  sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .  he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .  peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective .  he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .  this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .  why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work .  the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work .  1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .  shall we go back to basics ?

885	i suppose it was for temple matthews who written basically a remake even though there are few changes which just make it worse . spoilers : it is much similar to the original . melody , ariel 's new daughter is threatened by ursula 's sister , morgana . morgana escapes , but keeps her promise to take melody away from them . did ursula have a sister ? ! and she is not that great a villain as ursula was . this is where there is similarity . medoly is kept from the sea until morgana is captured , but she does n't know a thing about it , because it all happened when she was a baby . a wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out . she goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with sebastian , who is not as funny or fun as in the original . she finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds morgana . here is a similarity ; morgana tricks melody , making her happy by turning here into a mermaid . meanwhile , eric , melody and king triton look for her . to stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from triton . so melody does , because she does not know king triton is her father . she makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful . the penguins who live with them in an icy ocean , hate them because they are cowards . so they try to prove they are heroes and fail . that does not suit the little mermaid . and the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is ear - bleeding . you know why ? because the first had a great story . this one is not and is not magical . it is just an example of how bad many sequels are . melody finds them and they help to take her to atlantica to prove themselves . when they take the trident , ariel finds melody with morgana . melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to morgana , then she shows her true colours once she grabs it . poor ariel and melody are in her custody . the penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight morgana 's shark friend . sorry i did not mention him earlier . they finally prove themselves . eric , king triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before morgana by the power of the trident . melody takes it , throws it to triton and he ices morgana ( literally ) . then ariel apologises to melody and thinks it is all her fault . it was not ! ariel did the right thing to protect melody , but they never say so . triton offers melody to live in sea or land . she in fact has a " better idea " . she uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and mer - folk can be together . then everyone sings an awful song . the end . whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original . i do not dislike this because i am a teenager . i liked it when i was very very little . then as i grew older i began to see what is bad about this film . young , young kids will enjoy it , but it is likely that when they are in primary school , they will forget about it . normally i would think i over - judged a film and it was better than i remember when i watched it again , but not this one . it is even worse . story is no exception . if you thought , by reading this that the story is good , read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points : well , you know the story now . i am sorry for spoiling it for you , but i had to point out some bad parts of it . one of the worst things is the animation . colour is awful . the original had beautiful colour . watching this almost made me want to go blind . even the illustrations and landscape design were not good . the original had beautiful , magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well , making it a joy to watch . the music is unbearable . compared to the first , the music here is crap . songs are not that well composed and tara strong ( i think that is her name ) who did melody can not sing . she at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song . so much for having " melody " as a name . and the music is not at all beautiful or moving . little mermaid 1 won an oscar for it and it truly deserved it . this one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist . i did not like the voices . several people who played characters from the first , did the same ones in this . jodi benson is a great singer , but now that she is older , no offence to her , her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore . and i am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this . if i was chosen for this film , just by reading the script , i can tell it would be a bad film . the characters are different now . ariel is more wiser now , but annoying . they overdid her character , making her too mature . in sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason . she was sixteen in the first . there is little chance she changes . that is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life . screenwriters should think of that . they should think of the character . well , i suppose that is it for me . i hope you find my comment useful , because i am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view .

893	terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel .  unfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic .  this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte .  the best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order .  nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career .  had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film .  instead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story .  the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry .  with a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film .  hopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film .  i give this film .

901	the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars .  producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze .  gone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry .  cage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed .  seems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos .  fifty cars , to be exact .  poor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly .  if the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip .  literally .  if only someone could save him .  hmmmm . . wonder  what memphis is doing ?  in order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension .  shadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away .  will he catch him ?  there's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago .  will they get back together ?  shortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family .  will they reconnect ?  raines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime .  will memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ?  can you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ?  i'll bet you can .  following the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis .  he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts .  in a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions .  just as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it .  looks like everything might turn out alright after all .  you know this because the music swells on the crest of violins .  that's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame .  bruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand .  monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis .  or maybe it's just the cars .  duvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit .  i'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one .  lindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material .  the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis .  without saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie .  like a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal .  too bad his minutes onscreen are so few .  somehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes .  every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie .  there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot .  it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test .  imagine the yuks .  there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick .  it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk .  the ramifications are never explored .  then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars .  not only is it stupid , but it's against the law .  this is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along .  gone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory .  
902	every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .  mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .  did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?  the plot is deceptively simple .  george washington carver high school is having student elections .  tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .  mr . " m " ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .  and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .  the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .  you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .  _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .  what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .  the similarities are staggering :  tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .  max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .  the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .  max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive .  the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .  he even gets a bee sting .  the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .  he gets several bee stings .  and so on .  what happened ?  how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?  even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .  broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .  witherspoon is a revelation .  it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .  and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .  one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .  there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .  i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .  but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .  as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .  it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?  even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .  there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .

914	ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?  you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , " welcome back kotter . "  always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole .   " so , " you ask , " where is he now ? "  mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .  that's right .  i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time .  and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater .  you silly goose .  well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life .  but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection .  sorry about the segue , or lack thereof .  matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker .  he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug .  he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win .  in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play .  mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia .  mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand .  months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .  when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash .  although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .  to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .  this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .  rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former .  the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all .  there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .  except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .  the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .  we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them .  matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker .  ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth .  john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .  he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .  martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky .  while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .  perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen .  she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead .  a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor .  the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales .  one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .   " i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , " says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .  i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .  with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing .  you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again .  luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on .  the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .  it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world .  as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades .  wait !  as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace .  hang on !  packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house .  okay , i guess that's enough .  oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .

921	this is a direct sequel to ' the mummy 's hand ' ( 1940 ) , because the lead character , stephen banning ( played by dick foran ) is now thirty years older and is relating the story ( with the help of archival footage ) to his son 's fiancé . there are only two unusual aspects to the film : the early death of banning , and the presence of turhan bey . lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing , though given the nature of his role , he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about . there 's nothing scary about his presence , except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé , isobel ( elyse knox ) . dick foran gets second billing , but he 's killed off within the first fifteen minutes ! we 'd have to wait until ' psycho ' ( 1960 ) when a lead character ( janet leigh ) dies way before the end of the movie ! banning 's buddy from the first film , babe jenson ( now henson ) , shows up a little later looking much , much , older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original . it 's hard to believe it 's the same actor ! unfortunately , this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes . it 's then left up to banning 's son john ( played by bit player john hubbard ) to led the chase to the cemetery -- no ! the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to banning 's house to burn it down and kill the mummy . sound universally familiar ?   turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest , mehmet bey , to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis . with his ' exotic ' voice and appearance , it 's too bad he gets so easily killed . a better movie would have had ' babe ' take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy , with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay . but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films , put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universal 's other clunkers , although he also did ' don winslow of the navy ' ( 1942 ) as well as ' don winslow of the coast guard ' ( 1943 ) which also featured elyse knox . elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies ( 1946 - 1949 ) , and of course , turhan bey , with 43 movie and tv credits , is great in the title role of ' the amazing dr. x ' ( 1948 ) . the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric ( with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff 's office ) than the first ' kharis ' mummy film , but there 's little else of interest or excitement . i 'll give it a 3 .

925	as winter approaches , our state - owned broadcaster , the abc , has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights . this commenced with a twelve - year old movie length version of " emma " last sunday ; more recent versions of three other novels , " persuasion " , " northanger abbey " and " mansfield park " are to come . the curious thing about this production by a&e television networks , with script by the ever - reliable andrew davies , is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions , one starring gwyneth paltrow , and " clueless " , a " modernized " version , starring alicia silverstone , which transported the plot to beverly hills . perhaps as a result , even with kate beckinsale in the lead , this production sank without trace . as a general rule , much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length . the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters . an outstanding example is " brideshead revisited " which had 13 50-minute episodes back in 1982 . you only have to compare the very ordinary movie - length version of " pride and prejudice " in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six - part tv mini - series . it 's not that a novel should be filmed page by page , and some novels ( often not very good ones ) adapt wonderfully to film ( " atonement " is a recent example ) , but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm . given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation , this production is ok . kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self - assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly ( he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters  knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p&p ) . samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly  sybil fawlty on speed . bernard hepton as emma 's feeble father was also excellent . we saw the damp countryside , the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors , in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody . even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted , even allowing for the formalities of the times . i 'd have to look at the film again to be sure , but it might be due to the under - use of reaction shots . if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example , and compares well with the paltrow version . anyway , there is more to come !
926	this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion .  joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer .  loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup .  the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical .  the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him .  this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school .  joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents .  all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch .  the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever .  his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes .  this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist .  now , that's a smart kid .  but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends .  one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing .  throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! )  question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class .  nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted .  what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody .  the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! )  tells him his grandfather is all right .  his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . .  maybe that's for another film down the road .  this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo .  as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose .  though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better .  well , god bless him , if he can do that .  this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood .  it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god .  and that family of his , they're too good for words .  yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place .  for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one .

935	i caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was . even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated , the camera keeps going . the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration - camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing . do n't watch this movie if your already depressed . then again do n't watch it if your feeling really good .
936	synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium .  comments : this movie was boring .  plain and simple .  entrapment should not have been boring .  it stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible .  it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current " hot topic " in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 .  it has some genuinely well-staged action sequences .  so , what went wrong ?  plenty , unfortunately .  the major problem with entrapment is its script .  it has a been-there , done-that feel to it .  nothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) .  the screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e .   " 4 days to the millennium " ) .  this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days .  the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth " surprise " revelation is made .  entrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion .  the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production .  sean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as " never trust a naked woman . "  ving rhames' character seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all .  the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe .  this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it .  at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body .  entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) .  the tagline for this movie reads " the trap is set . "  it sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie .  entrapment really isn't that bad ; it is watchable .  i would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it .  
937	a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
938	dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it .  although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one " dead bore . "  in the film , johnson plays . . .  you guessed it . . .  a cop .  the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on " miami vice . "  a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life .  beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children .  she will not even allow him to wish them " merry christmas " by telephone .  but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang .  beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop .  his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp .  virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective .  the plot is incoherent and full of holes .  the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions .  the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense .  i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii .  in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction .  dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting .  according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck .  you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable .  most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above .  william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods .  forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable .  dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( " wkrp in cincinnati " and " frank's place " ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains .  the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less .  i guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang .  the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script .  johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life .  and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments .  the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him .  but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble .  the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen .  but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .

945	corey yuen's latest film , " hero " is notable on two fronts .  first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production .  secondly , the film is the re-discovery of yuen biao .  the film opens around the end of the qin dynasty , when many immigrants were making their way to shanghai .  poverty and crime rule most of china .  a young man , ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier .  tam see is the most powerful gangster in town , having control of the center of the city and having an alliance with the british army .  wing jing and see become friends during a confrontation .  their friendship grows as both men start to realize their dreams , wing jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man , and see to settle down with a woman he can truly love .  wing jing meets the singer at the club ( jessica hester ) and falls in love with her , not realizing that she is the star attraction .  after stealing her picture from a display , wing jing and his brother plot to impress her .  first they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths , and set up a midnight rendezvous .  unfortunately , wing jing has run afoul of a rival gangster , yeung seung who has bribed the police in an effort to gain control of see's night club .  the two bothers are arrested and held until they manage to escape just before dawn .  jessica , having waited outside in the cold with her manager all night , gives up and returns home .  see decides to retire , he gives the night club to wing jing , as repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder .  see arranges the trade and ask his lover ( valerie chow ) to take care of wing jing .  unfortunately , she has sided with yeung seung .  the performances in the film are all top notch , with fine turns by takeshi kaneshiro as ma wing jing and jessica hester and valerie chow .  the comic turn by yuen wah , previously known as the mad vietnamese in samo hung's " eastern condors " , is a marvelous surprise .  his gift for comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious .  the stand-out is by yuen biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments , with a stellar performance .  his tam see is a triad boss who knows that his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to uphold his pride .  his gangster is almost non-violent , in that he only retaliates , never instigates violence .  but when the time comes to fight , yuen biao has never looked better .  corey yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that has been lacking in hong kong movies as of late .  the lighting , cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch .  the action scenes do not disappoint either .  this is the most aggressive and inventive martial art choreography i've seen in some time , actually surpassing jackie chan's work in both 'rumble in the bronx' and 'first strike' .  the special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of making the impossible look possible .  an early fight between takeshi kaneshiro and yuen biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be believed .  also noteworthy is the score for the film , done in a marvelously lush orchestral style , not representative of most hong kong fare .  i would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both " titanic " and " rosewood " as best of the year .  all in all , " hero " marks a grand return to filmmaking for shaw brothers .  this is the film that gives us faith that hong kong cinema is alive and flourishing .

952	as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .  parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .  but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .  `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .  the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .  here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .  he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .  but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .  we see that he is a mean-tempered person .  he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .  he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .  he also has tremendous problems with relationships .  he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .  but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .  he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .  his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .  she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .  finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .  as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .  as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .  we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .  he is a prisoner and a slave to it .  he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .  what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?  we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .  this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .  he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .  we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .  to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .  very effective .  today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .  the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .  the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .  this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .  he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .  coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .  but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .  there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .  that may turn many moviegoers away .  but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .  
953	what hath kevin williamson wrought ?  while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films .  those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ .  add to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy .  the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas .  first , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling .  this sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer's look .  dressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman ,  sans the hook .  one thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise .  students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of " mythology " passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness .  it hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn't ) .  michelle , slain by the " killer lurking in the backseat " of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well .  the setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares .  too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door .  but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there's also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre .  banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor .  some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so .  the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent .  i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _  starlet jennifer love hewitt , but i'd talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto .  _dawson's_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor .  granted , the cast is hampered by their material .  loretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard .  the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive .  if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims .

956	the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .  i mean that as the highest compliment .  if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .  the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .  along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .  the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles " bud " tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .  they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .  complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .  in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .  john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .  claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .  andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .  cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .  it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .  a pall is cast on the whole affair .  a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .  in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .  we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .  during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .  all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .  the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .  so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .  or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .  ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .  they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .  bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .  norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .  we feel for him .  he's a decent man .  sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .  with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .  however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .

964	this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast .  eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck .  living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) .  maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances .  on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love .  their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again .  like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high .  their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy .  she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter .  during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy .  she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer .  she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage .  he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years .  during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) .  her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her .  joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life .  she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) .  but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was .  maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him .  perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing .  
965	places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
966	you don't need to have seen the original " species " to appreciate how utterly lousy " species ii " is .  with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that " species ii " is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable .  it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction .  the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle .  the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black .  that should have been the end of the movie right there .  back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate .  on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again " played " by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .  this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to " the dukes of hazzard " tv show , which she appears to enjoy .  eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk " mates , " which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .  eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on .  peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams " i told 'em not to go ! "  at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle .  michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns .  they're both unbelievably wooden .  what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( " the ruling class , " " the krays , " " let him have it " ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .  it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like " species ii . "  last year peter hyams gave us " the relic " ; no thanks necessary there .  and the first " species " was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects .  is it just that there are no better offers out there ?   " species ii " is worthless .  worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn .  it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film .  there is .  after 92 minutes , it ends .  
967	this movie fails miserably on every level . i have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we wo n't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? my god , i ca n't think of anything i 've ever seen that was this bad . i 'd rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , i 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . that 's my two cents .

972	based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island .  however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder .  while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself .  conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation .  his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice .  the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst .  without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement .  on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism .  in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another .  the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel .  its absence in the film is unforgivable .  the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers .  alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with .  the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him .  jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible .  unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script .  the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach .  all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone .  this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions .  the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) .  the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization .  while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma .  sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as " an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror " .  poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder .  sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back .  at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans .  despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended .  sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be .  the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production .  at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love .  a hollow victory indeed .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
973	time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
974	this is a typical late universal horror flick : its technically comptent , if by the numbers , with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting . the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton , a man with a bone disease as the film 's " monster " . its sad to see this man exploited , but he probably made good use of the money they paid him . hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped , as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing . martin koslack is on board as the film 's mad artist , and he is very amusing in this part . i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything ; for some reason the man amuses me . the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film 's absurd take on the art world . here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists ; this is side by side with the film 's male " hero " who is an " artist " who paints ... get this ... pin up girls . somehow our hero 's work is reviewed side by side with the villan 's absurdist sculpture . also amusing is the film 's chief nasty critic , who at one point claims that he despises the hero 's pin up art because " women like that do n't exist " to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just does n't get out enough . finally , there 's a bit of a subplot about the heroine 's ( who is an art critic herself ) domestication by the leading man .... completely anti - feminist and ridiculous to witness . overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements .

983	there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see " mission to mars . "  there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind .  but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " armageddon , " " apollo 13 , " " the abyss , " " close encounters of the third kind , " " e . t .  the extra-terrestrial , " " alien , " and " aliens . "  why ?  because there is not one original idea in " mission to mars . "  all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) .  if this is the sort of thing you don't mind , you might like the film .  of course , there are other reasons not to like " mission to mars , " the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven't used their brains in some time , and who don't intend to start during the film's running time .   " mission to mars " manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time .  the plot , cribbed greatly from " 2001 , " concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet .  luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians .  the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in " 2001 " -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in " 2001 " ) .  a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride .  after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel .  now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home .  after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth .   " mission to mars " is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film .  that's it .  everything else fails .  the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script .  only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in " 2001 " ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does " mission to mars " come to life .  a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes .  take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way .  the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , " 2001 " ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ?  why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ?  shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ?  why are the characters such idiots ?  because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them .  all the " conflict " is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : " jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together " -- does anyone really talk like this ?  can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ?  the whole film is like that .  the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time .  sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : " look , there's mars " astronaut b : " you sure that's mars ? "  astronaut a : " yeah , that's mars all right . "  astronaut c : " hey , are you guys looking at mars ? "  that exchange isn't actually in " mission to mars , " but i wouldn't be surprised if it were .  for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell .  de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten .  this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over .  fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .  the principal actors sleepwalk their way through " mission to mars , " never managing to do away with an apparent " i'm just here to get a paycheck " attitude .  cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .  armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .  robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard " decent guy " performance .  and sinise hams it up with " wistful " facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .  and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in " 2001 " who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world .  it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy " mission to mars , " but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going .  leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of " mission to mars " has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .  supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of " armageddon " ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .  me , i alternated between the two .  there is only one good thing about the way " mission to mars " finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .

995	8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .  the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .  all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .  welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide .  although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .  8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller .  the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage .  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )  here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .  and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent .  his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch .  catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .  her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year .  also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .  as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .  unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .  lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .  but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing .  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .  also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching .  8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity .  with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .  ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .  and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .  
996	enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
997	copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !  sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon .  as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) .  she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage .  henry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king .  there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution .  the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time .  the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !  owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't .  this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does .  by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor !  it looks like he has some explaining to do !  there are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal .  also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father .  the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good .  there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader .  the film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly .  there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along .  however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it .  
998	the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results .  when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler .  meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne .  the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim .  not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal .  i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail .  the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , " etc , etc , etc , " i would cringe .  literally .  speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking .  besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical .  the sole song which is used cleverly is " getting to know you , " which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to .  unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be .  take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst .  you're being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do ! ?  sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ?  believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says " etc . , etc . , etc . , " more and more as the film progresses .  no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end .  and where does this character's personality change ?  hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him !  isn't that the whole plot ?  the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy-har-har !  he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him .  by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation .  animated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time .  the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds .  i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting .  if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , " worst movie of the decade . "  instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst .  the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs .  not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it .  not the slightest bit .

1006	the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film " the world is not enough " is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming " james bond will return . "  oh i certainly hope not .  with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , " the world is not enough " is the best example to date that " 'enough " is enough .  in this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original .  we've got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines .  we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them .  we've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache ) .  and , as has been the case since 1977's " the spy who loved me , " we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming .  we've also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from " tomorrow never dies . "  while originality was never the series' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts .  i can't think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- " the world is not enough . "  in addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as " coal miner's daughter , " " nell , " and the " 28up " documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s .  you get the " talking killer " plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age .  and you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can't hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film's opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond's souped-up " fishing boat " with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her .  later , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out .  these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards .  in and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , " braveheart " 's sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she's terrible ) , " wild things " ' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she's laughable ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond's walther ppk ) .  brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you'd expect of the former " remington steele " star , but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck .  he's given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver , but only one of them-- " i don't know any doctor jokes " --made me chuckle ( although " i thought christmas only comes once a year " is more in keeping with the series' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) .

( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio )   " unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise .  unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited .  unlike fires , there is no way to combat them .  unlike floods , their terror is sudden . "  - excerpt from twister production notes  i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .  i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .  the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .  it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .  basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up !  twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .  these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that  is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !  jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .  while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .  apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .  he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .  jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .  the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .  to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .  thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .  plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .  twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .  there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .  helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !  thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !  jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .  like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited .  audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !  the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !   ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .  now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent !  watch it in a good theatre . . . please .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

1014	brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him .  sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters .  nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . )  an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy .  the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together .  however , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long , and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end .  although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead .  the problem is that de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with .  he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored .  nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it's no use .  they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable .  yes , another problem with the film is that there's no-one to root for .  we're supposed to be on cage's side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film .  however , his change is sadly unbelievable .  poor gary sinise's character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way .  the film's use of flashback quickly gets boring .  while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go .  they certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie .  there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one .  the script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional .  certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller .  the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential .  there's a good story buried in snake eyes , it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks .  it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end .  while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy 'number cruncher' wrapped up in the case , there's no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided .  a david wilcock review ? 1998   " you know , for kids " - norville barnes

1016	call it touched by a demon .  gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist .  if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven .  in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .   ( remember bob ? )  the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope .  a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice .  now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around . "  shortly thereafter , he begins to sing " time is on my side " as he's taken on his last walk .  minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead .  but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .  and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will .  only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against .  the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger .  as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .  no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown .  the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks .  shadows and night scenes abound .  the days are cloudy and unpromising .  this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men .  fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized .  somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise .  but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check .  nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .  the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual .  of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance .  john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .  sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel .  everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring .  washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .  it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting .  there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes .  as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was .  washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency .  however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland .  to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .  that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work .  both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .  narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .  although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .  at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like " i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow .  in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .  however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved .  the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected .  it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did .  at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .  this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .  and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .  
1017	some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time .  playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one .  congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing .  some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed .  then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet .  harsh ? maybe .  justified ?  hell yes !  this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes .  for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away .  this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : " oooh , look look !  john woo !  two guns blazing !  slooooow motion ! "  and if that wasn't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie .  poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better .  unlike most movies this one does not suffer from " stupid bad guy " syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes .  example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages .  now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero .   ( term used as loosely as possible )  survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds .  even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger .  mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not .  some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that !  two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second .  solution ?  boom !  i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much .  another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome :  our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her .  he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers .  he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ?  no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car .  and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised !  while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ?  i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door .  ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life .  this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better .  is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ?  for instance :  our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment .  ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time .  but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ?  he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt .  oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling .  going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun .  for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several " oh come on ! "  moments .

1020	the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions .  that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright .  he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .  now don't think i condone this just because i'm male .  my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .  darnell doesn't think like this .  he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .  and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , " i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? "  after all , it is largely darnell's fault .  if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .  but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .  you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .   ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )  now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .  one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .  brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's " immature play " as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .  but all of a sudden she says yes .  but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !  lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .  look at this movie .  four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary .  there are some bright spots , though .  whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .  and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film .

1022	actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie .   " baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen .  at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage .  and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire .  you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in .  i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there .  they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not .  a nipple hallucination sort of thing .  barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions .  yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one .  she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience .  you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills .  i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention .  the movie is set in the year 2017 , " the worst year of my life , " pam says .   ( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . )  america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) .  she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute .  but don't call her " babe . "  she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times .  imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term .  a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like " babe " during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success .  the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners .  in the words of one of the characters , they're " more than meets the eye . "  reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened .  no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) .  thank god they didn't name her cora reef .  one bad character name is more than enough .  pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi " always " video fame .  i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) .  pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest .  it's not rambo . . .  it's bimbo !  mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year .  it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free .  it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo .  there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen .  someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars .  if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements .  barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death .  this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct .  barb wire has only two things going for it . . .  and i think you know what those two things are .

1032	capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities .  mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness .  you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india .  the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala .  her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi .  a wealthy family is having a wedding .  an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial .  even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together .  the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines .  aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us .  she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor .  latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey .  dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration .  even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants .  several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both .  there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love .  some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films .  western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna .  on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films .  this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english .  the latter will , however , help with an international release .  sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog .  we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference .  director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
1033	the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '  the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught .  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .  always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .  this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .  when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .  now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .  carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .  she's a very bright person with a good heart .  yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .  worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .  they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .  to her , this made sense long ago .  but now , it's a different story .  wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .  wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .  however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change .  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .  carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .  maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .  the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . '  and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .  if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .  when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining .  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .  this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .  henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .  meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .  however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .  the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .  `where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .  newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .  he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .  fiorentino is also a fun presence .  you root for her despite her sense of amorality .  sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic .  with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .

1056	i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .  even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .  but i don't care .  not even a little .  my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .  2 ) drew barrymore is great .  3 ) the movie is so funny .  there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .  i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .  sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .  in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .  a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .  with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .  she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .  julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .  soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .  oh sure , it's trite .  and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .  what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .  barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .  not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .  and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .  naturally , the true star here is sandler .  i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .  he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .  his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .  whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .  as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .  and the movie is just so funny .  perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .  this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .  and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .  my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .  the film is predicable , but who cares ?  the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .  in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .  in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .  i just want everyone to know that i laughed .  a lot .

1088	 " what's your favorite new york moment ? "   " this one's climbing the charts . "  starring john cusack , kate beckinsale , eugene levy , molly shannon .  directed by peter chelsom .  rated pg-13 .  there's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl .  in rare cases , the genders are flipped .  predictability is a given .  rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its " theme " as an excuse for its plot contrivances .   " lightweight " doesn't begin to describe it .  this is like anti-gravity .  it begins in a new york city bloomingdale's , a product placement that rivals cast away's fedex for sheer blatancy .  jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves .  after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating .  jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed .  when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand .  she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted .  to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend .  when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( " love in the time of cholera " ) and sell it to a used bookstore .  if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together .  three years later .  both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests .  both realize they aren't content .  both go looking for the other .  what happens now is so absurd that i'm almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it .  the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible " coincidences " that i would describe as contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around " serendipity . "  of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases .  i'm not buying it .  there's no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what's going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly " adorable " non-story into our heads .  instead of " will they meet ? "  the question we're asking is " when will they meet already ? "  to make matters worse , every " coincidence " is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else " incredible " was going to happen .  cusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn't saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she's had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one .  serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy , who plays a snarky bloomingdale's salesman .  what's the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ?  serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings , but it only tests our patience .

1102	who would have thought ?  jim carrey does drama .  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , " what a hilarious idea for a movie ! "  however , it was an even better premise for a drama .  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .  that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .  truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .  christof is the " god " of this made-up world .  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .  the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .  we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .  it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .  the film can be described in one word : weird .  it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .  it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it .  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .  the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama .  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .  and he showed them all up .  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .  i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .  he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .  he ventures into the wrong elevator .  a light crashes in front of him .  his father comes back and is then pulled away .  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .  peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape .  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .  despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the " god " of truman's world .  he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .  the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .  but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .  it really makes you think .  maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .  i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .  overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .

1105	martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life .  it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker .  this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest .  newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful .  the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others .  on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life .  archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen .  archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world .  archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status .  the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not .  it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions .  there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for .  in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun .  the performances are absolutely breathtaking .  day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take .  pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well .  ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending .  the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory .  scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking .  his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight .  he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery .  his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed .  it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully .  the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere .  he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important .  the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing .  the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world .  there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite .  not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else .  and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end .  a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year .

1116	capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops .  the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds .  a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures .  then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen .  this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately .   ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . )  the plot is simple but not simpleminded .  sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell .  along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto .  in other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted .  ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( " by an all-white jury " , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why .  there's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie .  in one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet .  we're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous .  the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands .  one scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack .  another note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind .  ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows .  
1117	incoherence reigns . 
1118	one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself .  such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch .  made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , " warped , twisted masterpiece " of lynch clan .  kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract .  but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion .  the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair .  cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship .  during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her .  after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping .  she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms .  apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father .  despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray .  jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos .  the actors aren't good either .  julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him .  bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend .  sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film .  the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion .  one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's " regular " girlfriend , played by betsy clarke .  the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated .  all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger's career .

1121	a genuine mind-bender . 
1122	claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story , that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will . ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non - linear film is the older man living on the french - swiss border , a man devoted to his dogs , who still has a lover , but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life . he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him , but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago . what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul , the vastness of nature , man 's interaction with people vs animals , etc . much of the time the ' film ' does n't make sense , but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures . life is sort of like that : we look , see , observe , integrate , process , and make of it what we will . in using this form of film making ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful ' beau travail ' ) claire denis has developed a signature technique . whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information . this is an interesting and visually captivating film , but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little . perhaps watching again will change that . grady harp

1124	ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls .  yes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual " identities , " they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of " girl power . "  but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world .  the film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- " scary " ( melanie brown ) , " baby " ( emma bunton ) , " sporty " ( melanie chisolm ) , " ginger " ( geri halliwell ) , and " posh " ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad " too much " ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) .  a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant " mate " ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) .  capped off by a live rendition of the girls' bouncy hit " say you'll be there , " a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ?  wrong . it's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches .  i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the " wacky " goings-on .  spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride .  while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a " dance bootcamp " scene , the girls sing the lyric " we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra " --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level .  some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford .  the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond .  ha ha .  as weak as the script is , i think there's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves .  the point is not that they can't act ( and , for the record , they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world .  posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film .  baby's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out .  there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being " ginger " or " scary " ?  apparently , just their wardrobes .  spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices' signature hit , " wannabe . "  the song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) .  this section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff .  spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful .  but this sloppy enterprise surely won't win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states .  once the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices' final hurrah in america .

1137	first let me say that i am not a dukes fan , but after this movie the series looked like law and order . the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg . burt reynolds is not boss hogg , and even worse was m.c. gainey as roscoe , if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop . he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie . the movie is loaded with the usual errors , cars getting torn up , and continues like nothing happened . the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett , and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop , but goes on to win the race .

1148	for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies .  from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .  but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves .  shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time .  sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a .  pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .  no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul .  the excitement starts before the music even begins .  a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so .  there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .  and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! "  you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .  this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .  it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .  and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .  even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .  the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .  all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .  in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .  for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .  all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .  the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .  if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled .  it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .  instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

1164	if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep .  if it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week .  if it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs .  if it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez .   ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip .  for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .  this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )  snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater .  snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ?  if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ?  is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ?  will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ?  and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?  the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .  if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .  the trailer is a work of sheer genius .  it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .  the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .   ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )  but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .  the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .  unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .  the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .  the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .  the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .  without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .  as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .  de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .  he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) .  on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .  snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .  the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .  there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done .  this is what's called giving the devil his due .  but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .  placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .  snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .  cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .  the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind .  however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .  
1165	this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
1166	though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious .

1174	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
1175	ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too .   " she's all that " has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i've seen so far this year .  and quite frankly , i doubt i'll see anything equally bad .   ( at least , i * hope * i don't see anything equally bad ) .   " she's all that " tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular .  that , right there , is problem #1 .  how many times have we seen this storyline ?  as cook comments near the end of the film , " it's kind of like " pretty woman " , except without the prostitution " .  of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward .  as it is , though , " she's all that " relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead .  there's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured .  the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible .  i usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said .  cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was .  i was never convinced that she was a " nerd " , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary .  the movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are .  as for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here .  he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character .  kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook .  and for some indiscernable reason , he's got hearing aids .  no explanation is given and they're never brought up .  were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ?  i don't think so .  that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i've seen in a movie in a long time .   " she's all that " sucks .  that's what it boils down to .  it's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer .  the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial .  and what's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens .  it appears to be telling them , " hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are .  that's unimportant .  if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron . "  ugh .  
1176	when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
1177	exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
1178	for a movie about disco-era excess , " 54 " comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club .  think of it as a sort of " boogie nights " -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , " 54 " leaves the kinkier details to your imagination .  it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either .  in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , " 54 " would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle .  studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 .  inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did .  the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from " i know what you did last summer " ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines .  his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course .  once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs .  he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy .  he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own .  after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 .  but fame doesn't come without a price .   " 54 " 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act .  alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since " 54 " sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there .  nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar .  the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .  that " 54 " works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled .  sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision .  the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( " the wedding singer " 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a " funky little treat . "  the solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot .  newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it's a shame their subplot goes nowhere .  meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in " clueless " ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , " one , two , three , attitude ! "  sherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big '70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left " er " as rubell's accountant , but she's criminally underused .  as the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone .  when he's not playing the life of the party , the ex- " saturday night live " comedian strips away all of rubell's confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it's a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees .  and while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate " austin powers " -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with " 54 " 's overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball .

1181	jerry springer has got nothing on " wild things . "  john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline .  but even trash tv topicality can't drag " wild things " down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast .  despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here .   " wild things " would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it .  high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent .  hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped .  before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court .  the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph .  while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her .  to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million .  but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can .  duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations .  if there's a major drawback to " wild things , " it's that it's oversexed to a fault .  the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off .  it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often .  what we don't see is far more effective than what we do .  another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene .  er , no thanks .  also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten .  daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's " rent , " tries to compensate for a superfluous character .  theresa russell is just plain wooden .  and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary .  but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end .   " wild things " has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship .  a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off .  and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell .  speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in " starship troopers . "  matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision .  neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio .  re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths .  but what we're given works well enough .   " wild things " is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .  
1182	a couple of criminals ( mario van peebles and loretta devine ) move into a rich family's house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels .  however , someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them .  writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists , but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work , editing and pacing .  it felt as though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark , but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go .  daniel baldwin ( i can't believe i'm about to type this ) gives the best performance in the film , outshining the other talented members of the cast .

1192	mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .  
1193	it should have been a classic .  a great cast of respected supporting actors .  an interesting premise of loser comic book characters .  however , " mystery men " proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 .  the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals .  the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise .  the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all .  the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons .  they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film .   " mystery men " might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business .  but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought .  thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie .  the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy .  the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city .  captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity .  after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured .  it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day .  by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low .  there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention .  the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down .  right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie .  instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was .  a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work .  another major problem with " mystery men " is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances .  the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion .  however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way .  to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about .  as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes .  fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of " american pie " and " there's something about mary . "   " mystery men " drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining .  anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way .  so why continue to watch ?  this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure .   " mystery men " indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says " i knew you could do it ! "   " mystery men " fails in every category it attempts to pass .  what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable .  terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors .   " i'm unpredictable ! "  an overexcited ben stiller shouts out .  no ben , you're the complete opposite .  
1194	underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today .  1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year .  we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them .  this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films .  critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment .  but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie .  the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend .  her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted .  after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck .  of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her .  however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money .  she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years .  while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there .  she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again .  which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it .  after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones .  he is a man who has had his share of bad things .  while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not .  whatever happens the film was excellent to me .  i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great .  ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie .  even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how .  this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen .  it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way .  the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made .  it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances .  the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years .  even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it .  the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie .  i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability .  it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting .  it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .

1200	some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies .  that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film .  such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in .  something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community .  one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california .  van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home .  however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film .  infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself .  unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless .  things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) .  almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars .  it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt .  in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience .  for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s .  on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great .  but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons .  the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called " sexual revolution " , same as all other " revolutions " of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity .  instead of being " liberated " , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms .  schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job .  the difference between the two is simply in the line of work .  many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda .  on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest .  in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare .  the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda .  van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body .  on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin .  even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end .  unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale .  the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver .  apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike .  but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival .  until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s .  hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists .  the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising .  anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema .

1204	i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one .  the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring .  in my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong .  if you were expecting airplane ! -like  laughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment .  however , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see .  honest , it is .  this story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 .  penny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks .  among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back .  unfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation .  while trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn .  mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time .  along with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a .  law ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait .  the special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes .  although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie .  overall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use .  some comments collected from friends :

1216	i know that " funnest " isn't a word .   " fun " is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective .  but that's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . "  no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! "  so to hell with webster's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while .  i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner .  the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .  one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .  she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . "  what sort of pies ?  chicken pies , of course .  co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . "  the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .  part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .   " the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .  but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .  now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . "  the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .  thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .  part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?  park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .  but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .  another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .  there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . "  the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . "  there's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .  the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it .  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution .  consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .  out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .  why ?  because once you got past the thought that " they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .  they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .  conversely , " chicken run " doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .  if you've never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun .  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .  park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .  enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer .  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .  ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it .  she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .  the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .  poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .  they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise .  the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .  the animation is first-rate .  remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is .  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .  as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame .  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .  anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .  funnest damn movie i've seen all year .

1219	you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man .  while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies .  even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film .  it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly .  i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good .  but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved .  i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams .  things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) .  caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous .  the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years .  powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial .  through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell .  even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting .  as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas .  the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action .  gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual .  the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and " suggested by " a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) .  nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct .  unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting .  turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots .  first , we have the prison warden subplot .  the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine .  there's also the prison guard subplot .  the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion .  then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man .  if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films .  the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here .  the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had .  ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption .  hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs .  and then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film .  perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth .  the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are " takers , " that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas .  i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film .  this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards .  what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ?  if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today .  if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors .

" life 's dramas " , presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable ( not even the writing has any bite or wit ) . the cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another , and the music and photography are lugubrious ( a couple of the visual effects are laughable , indie - cliché touches that reek of a puny budget ) . although written and directed by a man , this was produced by a woman , and i 'm not sure but i think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men , estranged brothers growing closer , never quite gels , never feels natural or seems lived in . it 's an attempt to get inside a male relationship , but the careful , sterile presentation is a cheat . no one 's heart is in this , living , breathing , or bleeding this material .

1231	carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall .  the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects .  action and science fiction just don't get any better than this !  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) .  quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars .  while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased .  now the people who did it are after him .  quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead .  the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist .  it grabs you and never lets go !  this film is a winner from beginning to end .  the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga .  schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too .  the action and stunts are terrific .  the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail .  the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action .  the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish .  the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal !  the visuals had such a state of the art " slickness " that they won an oscar .  of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science .  for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do .  who cares ?  it's a movie .  movies are supposed to entertain .  and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat .

1235	synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride .  not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit .  soon , julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back .  review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it's unlikely that " original sin " could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars .  this is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions .  that said , " original sin " could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it .  instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such .  the result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill .  consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show .  cristofer doesn't even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless .  at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren't being given the chance .  the same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent .  also unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film's denouement .  
1236	for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects .  but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark .  the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him .  he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars .  then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter .  raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing .  raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck .  but these are the least of billy's problems .  billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer .  billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis .  she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it .  she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments .  if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it .  this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing .  while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it .  there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose .  take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy .  the film is filled with these " character moments " that never really achieve anything .  granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us .  the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles .  the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into .  the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices .  a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience .  oldman got it about half right .  
1237	the word to describe sharon stone is " wonder " .  not that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent .  she has a dynamic screen presence in " basic instinct " , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in " casino " , but possesses neither of those here .  stone teams up with private school headmaster's wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani's thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) .  in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to' [read " steal from " ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe . . .  kathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective .  her character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling .  adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation .  it's stone that is a disappointment among the actors .  how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ?  costumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous .  even the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out .  on the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive .  that is if you can put up with stone's cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch's movies .

1241	i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality .  but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations .  it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .  in addition , it's also a terrific family film .  this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools .  it could also be described as `mrs .  streep's opus' .  yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad .  out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view .  she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?  slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .  one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven .  after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama .  at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .  it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr .  holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth .  the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .  yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work .  angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .  blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest .  gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force .  it's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner .  the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin .  there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman .  in it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth .  it's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision .  it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal .  watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ?  of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ?  mission accomplished , wes .  thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film .  in it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile .  the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme .  the mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . .  basically everything is there .  it doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing .  the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals .

1243	the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call " the reality check movie series " , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz .  all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game .  the thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it .  in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus .  in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game .  in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices .  there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated .  the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make .  rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds .  after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only .  the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days .  all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ?  douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller .  along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol .  the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests .  i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film .  unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened .  the scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , " what is the point of this ? "  sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true .  i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is .  on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl .  in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances .  another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase .  don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would .  thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough .  the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the " reality check " based movies for awhile .

1251	when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games .  why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ?  the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw .  this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack .  the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the " outworld " , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity .  the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined .  here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation .  how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , " i knew love would keep us together , " since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh .  there are some seriously stupid things in this movie .  take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the " inner winds " , generated by earth's magma flows .  you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast .  how fast ?  as katana says , " you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . "  what ?  later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn " red " williams , otherwise known as " saber " on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu .  how do we know this is where she went ?  there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii .  remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign .  i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are .  there's a lot of major flipping action , too .  the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another .  do they land and immediately get into the fighting ?  does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ?  do they collide in mid-air ?  no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away .  why did they need those metal balls to travel ?  everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b .  i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics .  the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly .   " ouch " was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one .  you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next .  it seems that's all there is in this movie .  maybe it is .  as i had mentioned , the acting is bad .  there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny .  after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , " you look good in mud .  no , really , you do . "  remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang .  brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say .  the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half .  another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene .  all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids .  hey , just like the video game !

1269	synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas .  arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand .  comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series " party of five . "  i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube .   " party of five , " i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre .  neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show .  so too is jennifer love hewitt .  lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line .  though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout .  jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting .  she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either ) .  this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure .  add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience .  i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason .  i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .  nothing else here is original or interesting .  this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art .  i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture .  the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook .  they may as well have huge targets painted on them .  like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .  unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny .  in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough .  the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .  several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie .  this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for .  and what is the deal with the slasher himself ?  i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .  come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate .  though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something .  so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy .  both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .  hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite .   .   . titillating .  this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system .  otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves .  early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas .  she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever .  i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part .  oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive !  people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .  boring !  i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .  admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them .  it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass " mystery science theater 3000 " -type viewing .  i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is .  if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel .  i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy .  i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .  what a depressing thought .  hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act .  rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted .  i'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience .

1274	depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal .  but in case you didn't know this , don't bother remembering it . . .  the words " original sin " never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it .  the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) .  regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) .  boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife .  since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful .  skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills .  original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller .  we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her .  but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money .  girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the " other man , " a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place .  add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year .  don't even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal .  just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it's much worse than a sin .  this is sacrilege .

1297	since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .  now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .  this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows .  most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .  that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .  the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia .  it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .  the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .  after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , " anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . "  drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .  with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things .  october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .  johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here .  he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust .  he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm .  his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father .  the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .  laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need .  her role is instantly likeable .  chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .  he's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .  the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .  there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .  it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .  october sky should be a success with audiences .  although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .  it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .

1307	robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style .  the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force .  1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike .  to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city .  on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one .   ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . )  after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i .  recruits his remains for their new " robocop " program .  using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal .  the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i .  engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) .  with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i .  envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems .  the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers .  as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective .  dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects .  several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics .  because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater .  although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre .  rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society .  the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors .  these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore .  the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood .  1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society .  the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd .  verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary .  unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre .  the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens .  robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character .  we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot .  does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ?  the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action .  moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine .  robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends .  as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before .  in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish .  however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .

1311	i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes .  oddly , i've never given much thought to either of the two .  maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam .  yes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties .  it seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film .  as this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty .  the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true .  for those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place .  chris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer .  their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable .  but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie's happiness .  and when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself .  despair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity .  chris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie's fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare .  this film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell .  it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares .  it's shape and look is as infinite as our imagination .  as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself .  certain questions baffle him at first .  why does his home in heaven ooze with paint ?  what is the significance of the asian stewardess ?  why does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ?  but as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie .   " dreams " is both visually and tellingly beautiful .  alas , i have one regret .  the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying .  it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments .  however , your eyes will still well up with tears and you'll find lots to savor .  the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed .  the journey is imaginative .  and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film .  
1312	this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were , this film , unlike other hollywood films to date , is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities . the film begins in a courtroom in the future -- after the war is over ( the film was made in 1944 - -the war ended in may , 1945 ) . in this fictitious world court , a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm 's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks . at first , it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis . however , after a while , it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster . these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama . all in all , the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second - tier actors . there are many compelling scenes and performances -- especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that ca n't help but bring you close to tears . it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super - creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . overall , it 's a must - see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film . fyi -- this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film , but hitler was referred to as " that paper hanger " . this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . this is in fact not true -- previously he 'd been a " starving artist " , homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi . a horrible person , yes , but never a paper hanger !

1319	natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree .  both films glamorize " outlaws , " in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .  but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant .  where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological .  what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores .  what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill .  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields .  for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed .  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .  brahma created .  vishnu preserved .  and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .  your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers .  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena .  muslims kill christians .  hindus kill muslims .  christians kill pagans .  jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .  religion is an orgy of killing .  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .   " the state is the divine idea upon earth , " hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc .  well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?  let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex .  consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other .  during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .   ( parenthetically , witness plato as well .  in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . )  catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil .  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .  this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence .  as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .  our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .  we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .  mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .  it is a straightforward liberation through sex .  as some good patriarch once observed , " you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . "  m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .   " the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , " as mickey says .  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .  we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .   " neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans " : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us .  beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . .  we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .  who else has found it ? --the  man of today ? -- " i  don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in " --so sighs the man of today . . . .  this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that " forgives " everything because it " understands " everything is a sirocco to us .  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !  as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say .  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure .  for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , " if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , " in his most excellent bill and ted voice .  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it .  let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her " the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! "  now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever .  it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .  as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory .  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .  upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else .  the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .  the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood .  also , jungian archetypes abound .  these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :  mickey to mallory : " one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , " in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off .  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .  at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .  the two of course go hand in hand .  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .  mickey during his marriage to mallory : " as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . "  the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too .  it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .  this is what mickey means by " creator of my universe , " he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes .  it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .  scagnetti's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth .  the indian sage releasing mallory's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : " old man , go be a snake , " after telling his " snake story " that ends with " bitch , you knew i was a snake . "  after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , " you killed life ! ! ! "  this is another telling quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of life .  then what were they killing up to that time ?  in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were .  in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents .  the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .  it of course symbolizes rebirth .  dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : " mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don't give a damn .

1322	review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders .  living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) .  nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life .   ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . )  not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however .  he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master .  in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello .   ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . )  but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) .  one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist .  and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money .  eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him .  one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them .  she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand .   ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers .  unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale .  aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again .  bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles .  aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise .  this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by .  matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral .  but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly .  this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind .  worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival .  now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death .  will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ?  will patrasche save the day ?  will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ?  a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages .  even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too .  there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself .  move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight .  the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film .  it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) .  the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century .  the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) .  the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) .  not that they are the only good stars , however .  jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character .   ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . )  also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william .  he's another one of my favorite characters in the film .  but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel .  he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest .  but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters .  for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff .  this one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama .  that , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful .  eleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders .  its heart is in the right place and it engages you .  you can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . '  in addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) .  other critics , however , were not so kind .  stephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing .  he found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . '  in addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . '  there have been so many other bad reviews like this , too .  my suggestion : disregard the critics .  they just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them .  this dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself .  this is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders .  it is also one of the better family films around this year .  none of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching .  if you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn .  go see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time .  see it while you can .  there is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie .  
1323	it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
1324	everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with " progress . "  giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .  his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .  this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three-dimensional human being .  despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .  and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .  giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go .  what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .  a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .  just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .  giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .   ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )  eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located .  bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .  eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .  but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .  love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .  in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .  it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .  in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .  in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .  from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .  it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .  jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .  he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .  meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .  love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a " fish out of water " tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .  yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots .  it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .

1332	us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that " back to the future ii " is one of the few exceptions .  if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future .  the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids .  doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) .  whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking , especially when it comes to the movies .  essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself .  at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything's copasetic right ?  wrong .  since when do things go according to plan in the " back to the future " movies ?  there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all .  basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath .  the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle .  it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail .  the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense .  instead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories .  by the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn't seem gratuitous .   " back to the future part ii " is a really great adventure movie .  it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor .  
1333	the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters .

1337	( only minor spoilers except as noted ) . i 've enjoyed a lot of spanish cinema recently ; both the actual spanish cinema of people like almodovar , and the latin american cinema of directors like del toro , whose superb " devil 's backbone " , set in civil war spain , was the finest horror film of the last decade . it 's no surprise , then , that this film is both well - made , well - acted , and manages to sustain that distinctively different spanish atmosphere . but it 's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see . what actually is the purpose of all this ? we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree , despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice - over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal . in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence , set more than a decade earlier , we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control - freakery ( "  if i ca n't have you nobody can  . " ) . oddly enough , that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film , but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree , which appears completely different in both motivation and execution . what happened to him in jail to cause this change ? we have no idea , though we do later discover , as an absurd sort of afterthought , that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned . in britain , in several of our notorious " serial killer " or " sex killer " cases , the terrible question arises ; what about the wife ? did she know , or suspect what was going on ? this is a question that this film could have asked , and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters . but banally , the answer to the question is quite clearly : " no , she did n't " . even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate , the film still manages to bungle it . all we actually get , sketched perfunctorily out at the end , is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event . compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place , where christie 's wife says " you know what i mean  . " thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror . ( major spoiler in this paragraph ) . in the meantime , we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police , thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again . how exactly did he achieve this ? the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point ; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police ; but how this all works or why , or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds , remains a mystery . i actually do n't believe serial killers are like this . the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff , but  lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right . they are deeply disturbed , deeply dysfunctional , deeply inadequate people ; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here ( closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie , or indeed even man bites dog , though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire ) . this film has little suspense , and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated . it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers , either generally , or in the specific cultural milieu of spain . this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women . and oddly , what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented . the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory . just one explicit shot , properly timed , would have been infinitely more shocking , and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary , freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation . instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear . very , very creepy . i 'm sorry to be rude ; i love horror films , and can tolerate even the most extreme , to the extent even of worrying my partner . but i think anyone who finds this film good , or interesting , even i 'd find myself edging away from . the purpose of a horror film is to scare you ; this is just lascivious . it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed . i have to give this film more than one star just because it 's competently executed , but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made .

1345	well then , thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie . i was about 5 when the original movie came out , and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing . so , now that i 'm 16 , and feeling masochistic enough , i decided to rent this movie . thus , i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie . this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it , right down to the last detail . in this movie , ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter , melody , and go to show her to everyone in the ocean ... broadway style ! after the musical number ends , within minutes , the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton does n't give up the trident . thus , he gives it up without even a fight . eric stands there gaping , though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody . morgana escapes , so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caught . well ... uh , nothing of note really happens . eric is a total wuss . he never really manages to do anything . ariel sort of does something . melody manages to screw things up . plus , the animation is a new low - point for disney . the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds . ever single opportunity for character development is wasted . the songs bite . look , do n't waste your time . i 'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this , since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens . they wo n't want to sing the songs . if you manage to grab a copy of this , throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it . ever .

1352	plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy .  but one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working .  a lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues .  critique : very cool !  now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight !  the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain " cute " chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year .  tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film .  he is pure evil .  they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man .  what a great , great monster !  my favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole " kiss of the dragon " thing to him and he cut him off by saying " kiss my ass ! "  pure action movie poetry .  anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his " acting " pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character .  actually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot .  fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay .  but in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances .  we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front .  and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i  say again . . . no  wire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute .  it's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts .  if that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film .  yes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place .  but was i entertained ?  thoroughly .  does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ?  yes , again .  does this sound interesting to you ?  well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you .  one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one .  in fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences .  all in all , a rippin' , roarin' fun time !  where's joblo coming from ?  black mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 )

1354	i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident .  they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail .  it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of .  frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know .  often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject .  film is a different medium .  it is a visual medium .  that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize .  i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space .  the magazine article and the film script are two very different media .  the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article " the man who knew too much " by marie brenner .  it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film .  it really verges on being tedious at least at times .  for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects .  but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .  the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .  the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .  the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs .  who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?  that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider .  this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well .  and in the end , he failed .  to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short .  the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist .  we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand .  they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) .  there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .  this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world .  terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power .  incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .  we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly .  he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family .  rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income .  meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .  they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data .  wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms .  he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman .  in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role .  and so the game begins .  wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer .  meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family .  the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants .  wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .  he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight .  al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider .  the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .  the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .  the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory .  it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling .  also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace .  plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly .  this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control .  michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style .  i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
1355	a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists .  in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character .  living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other .  this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant .  24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "  although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) .  for her to do photos for " frame , " lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her .  lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson .  the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin .  this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture .  syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club .  lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother .  lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being " pigeonholed , " and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses .  a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical .  that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny .   " your work has a cultural currency that is important now , " is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine .  when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , " i want to get high with you . "  in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand .  and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene .  this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions .  in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted .  high art runs 1 : 36 .  it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age .

1358	an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england .  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .  more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .  even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive .  although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive .  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .  if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .  and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing .  well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .  but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary .  with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens .  you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen .  but john , it just wasn't scary .  i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me .  actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films .  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .  it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material .  call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .  i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up .  werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) .  boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy .  including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital .  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse .  i know it sounds strange , but it actually works .  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie .  as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects .  while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch .  actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .  
1359	my wife is a fanatic as regards this show . that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order . i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad . alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy , embrace of the vampire to name a few , the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals . i 've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child . i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i do n't know if it was their own choosing or not . please . please do n't renew for another season as enough is enough , bob

1362	when discussing a movie titled ' snakes on a plane ' , we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot . what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy , they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures ? why not rely on suspense .. the whole ' less is more ' ethic . or better still , why not just make them look good in the first place ? and then maybe still use them sparingly take one look at john carpenters ' the thing ' . here we have real slime , and gore of eerie proportions . 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap ' snakes on a plane ' . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee ? special effects are going backwards ! sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke , get it ? sure i 'm with that idea , but do it well ! in addition to the above , this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way . i could handle every other actor being part of this movie , except for jackson . what was he doing there ? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago . is this career progression ? are you offering people value for money ? no . i 'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including ... doa : dead or alive , ( another ) cgi animal film called ' flushed away ' , and another crap looking comedy named ' click ' . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers , including one for ( another ) crap british horror / comedy . i 've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for £ 1 in 6 months time . and if you 're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes , and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .

1367	gus van sant has made some excellent films . i truly am a fan . however , i ca n't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book " even cowgirls get the blues " is lost in translation to the big screen . alone , tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . ultimately though this one just did n't work .   it was n't that the characters were n't well developed or the plot and content did n't come alive . it 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . we 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller - coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller - coaster detracting from the overall experience . this is what i believe happened here . i suggest reading the book !

1370	i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear . i completely disagree . i 'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there . i thought the casting was perfect . i thought this was one of ed harris 's best performances . what an evil psychopath ! ! ! i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie . i was riveted throughout this movie . if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see . i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie . this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it !

1385	now , lets first look into the history of shark films .  there was the unforgettable jaws .  the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) .  now , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones !  russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease .  the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones .  as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure .  with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days .  gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after .  this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all .  so-so acting , expected in most of your average action film .  jackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines .  ll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films .  deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer .  it does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour !  its like jurassic park under water .  nothing too stressful , pure entertainment .  renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) .

( although this is ruined by an over the top , one too many stunt and explosion . )  simple in construction , effective in it's execution , and the result , a clear and concise , highly enjoyable action film .  the acting is adequate , although it's darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a 'hot totty' appeal to the men ( and she does that perfectly ! ) , jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist .  overall , speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride .  not up to it's predecessor's high calibre but very good all the same .  there is plenty going on , some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie .

1400	finding the courage to face life full-on is a difficult task .  summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job .  if you're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you .  melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be .  a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible .  his obsessive-compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk .   ( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles . )  melvin has some great lines .  when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds " i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . "  don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist .  setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors .  when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute .  he's an equal opportunity bigot .  he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe .  melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him .  and she's none too happy about it .  when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it .  tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast .  the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food .  much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery .  this doesn't upset melvin much ( " don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time " ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey .  melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door .  he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side .  when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes .  this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up .  hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son .  he even develops a friendship with simon .  all three people are heavily damaged .  melvin has retreated from life in his apartment .  carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him .  simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out .  a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see .  and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments .  melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice .   " you make me want to be a better man , " he tells her .  one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon .  carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him .  it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest .  there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson .  i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment .  nicholson may be the best actor working today .  hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy .  she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch .  their on-screen chemistry is a bit odd .  each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there's something a little off .  it's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film .  director james l . brooks ( " terms of endearment " , " broadcast news " ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands .   " as good as it gets " isn't exactly the quality that the title says , but it's pretty darn close .

1418	the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images .  the tinkling christmas tree bell in " it's a wonderful life . "  bogie's speech at the airport in " casablanca . "  little elliott's flying bicycle , silhouetted by the moon in " e . t . "  and now , " starship troopers " director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug .   " starship troopers , " loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .  in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale .  to put it simply , it's a bug bomb .  in " robocop " and " total recall , " verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and " starship troopers " starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .  things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .  inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .  it's a veritable " alpha centuri 90210 " as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love .  michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .  eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .  one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( " doogie houser's " neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .  he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg .  a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the " showgirls " director's camera roams over their buff bodies .  finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .  the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .  they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .  yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .  a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .  sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter .  the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .  the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .  while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly .  verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children " doing their part for the war effort " by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .  one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .  his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders .  in " showgirls " fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .  an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing " dixie " on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .  a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying .   " it's okay , " she gasps , " i got to have you ! "  and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug .  it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .  heinlein's pre- " stranger in a strange land " books were aimed at adolescent males , and " starship troopers " has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .  the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .  the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .  ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant .  he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .  it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie .  avoid " starship troopers " at all costs .  
1419	beware of movies with the director's name in the title .  take " john carpenter's ghosts of mars " ( please ) .  if the carpenter brand name wasn't superglued to the title , this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network .  and i would have been spared a headache .  the latest from the director of " starman , " " halloween " and " escape from new york " is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic horror flick .  the production is set on mars in 2176 , where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world .  six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet , terra-forming to make it more hospitable for future generations .  a matriarchal society .  terra-forming .  sounds pretty intriguing , eh ?  well , don't get your hopes up .

1422	8mm is not going to enlighten your day .  it's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence .  not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well .  nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late .  he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality .  cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability .  at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of .  his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe .  the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered .  or so it seems .  welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth .  and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head .  he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography .  max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change .  the devil changes you . '  these turn out to be very wise words .  8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution .  the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her .  this is where everything goes awry .  although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula .  everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .  although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control .  cage is the film's sole flame of energy .  his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .  still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .  welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry .  this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film .  he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie .  written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece .  furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ?  the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) .  this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .

1433	synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york .  disco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy .  in fact , they're terrified .  as in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring .  the cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam .  no one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe .  all around new york people are different .  aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals .  in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) .  vinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know .  ritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut .  everyone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as " alien " to the community .  unfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor .  opinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer .  nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him .  it's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion .  one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex .  in other movies sex is glamorized .  for example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning .  or boring made-for-video " suspense " movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake .  and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess .  not so with summer of sam .  in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy .  sex is there , but it isn't gratuitous or titillating .  in fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed .  sex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of " difference " breeding hostility .  in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking .

1435	in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents' relationship while trying to define their own in writer/director tran anh hung's ( " the scent of green papaya " ) " the vertical ray of the sun . "  youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen-khe ) greets the day with hai ( ngo quanq hai ) , the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with .  their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suong's ( nguyen nhu quynh ) cafe , where lien works , for breakfast .  the three sisters lovingly prepare their mother's memorial banquet of traditional delicacies , prepared as much for look as taste , while giggling over the differences between the sexes .  after the family breaks from the banquet , we learn that suong's young son 'little monkey' is doted upon , but there's a distance developing with her husband quoc ( chu ngoc hung ) , who's leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips .  middle sister khanh ( tran manh cuong ) tells her writer husband she's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan , a mysterious man in his mother-in-law's past .  lien keeps crawling into hai's bed at night , causing him to fall out of it .  the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later , as the three women prepare their father's memorial banquet .   " the vertical ray of the sun " is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors .  sly humor , self deceit and harsh truths all exist in the cyclic screenplay .  tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark lee ping-bin ( " flowers of shanghai " ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part .  small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy .  the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film's visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues .  writer/director tran anh hung's film recalls ang lee's " eat drink man woman , " another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent .  but while lee's more traditionally story-driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , " the vertical ray of the sun's " characters strive for peaceful harmony .  watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day .

1441	synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .  technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .  lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .  opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .  in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .  real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .  
1442	defending your life is an imaginative vision of the afterlife from the twisted mind of writer-director albert brooks , who also stars in the comedy .  after dying in a car crash , on his birthday of all days , brooks wakes up in judgement city , a satirical rendition of purgatory where higher beings evaluate the lives of newly deceased earthlings .  brooks has five days to convince two judges that he's worthy of passing on to higher plains of existence .  enter rip torn as the slick lawyer who defends brooks in court against prosecutor lee grant .  during his " trial , " brooks must view episodes of his life on a movie screen , and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant .  it's impossible to resist chuckling ( and cringing ) at brooks as he and torn try to explain away his cowardly behavior on earth .  torn , in particular , is in vintage comic form , and he walks away with the picture .  the movie also features meryl streep , appealing as the love-interest , and shirley maclaine , who pops up in a hilarious cameo .  while the film is uneven , many of its gags are price less .  take , for example , the food in judgement city : it's always the most delicious you've ever tasted . . .  and it's also calorie-free--so chow down !  
1443	i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie . i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films . this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it . yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts . actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great . i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time . the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense . the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring . perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure . the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963 . it was even more scary . see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin .
1444	in our time .  in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' .  and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic .  in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away .  though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry .  the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese .  the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered .  the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers .  it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death .  escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate .  but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty .  the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . .  there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production .  and there are more problems besides its title .  of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece .  we call it 'modernization' .  it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights .  this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing .  kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature .  and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare .  i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing .  i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing .  he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision .  unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments .  his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow .  the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified .  jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice .  their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act .  they are nothing more than two celebrities put together .  the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances .  delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality .  but there's more than acting to worry about .  even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing .  to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film .  it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be .  and in the end it's nothing .  there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises .  so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement .  this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences .  the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre .  it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it .  but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' .  as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects .  it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any .  for someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film .  for those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells .

1448	senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life .  alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise .  granted , that one joke is initially amusing .  when wayans's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses .  after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm .  at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless .  this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp .  but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale .  once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness .  wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration .  senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle .  however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity .  darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie .  unlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing .  any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind .  once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him .  but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

1461	when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august .  happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater .  unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory .  worse , actually .  fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer's secret diary . "  for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved .  the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish .  the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon .  the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper .  lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later .  ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti's distinctive musical score chimes in .  wrong !  the movie proves that you really can't go home again , or at least lynch can't .  only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos .  the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv's most enigmatic town .  cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna .  the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth .  the night of laura's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film's only remotely effective sequence .  we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere .  her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers .  but it's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie .  
1462	this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned .  the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now .  eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect  starring : tom cruise ( dr .  bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : " traumnovelle " by : arthur schnitzer  this is an interesting film .  i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film .  cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist .  the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written .  the translation , " dream novel , " makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film .  there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film .  rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting .  i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could .  this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly .  as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one .  the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur .  you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice .  16 months for this ?  wow .  reflection is the biggest killer for this film .  their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly .  one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the " austin powers " version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them .  two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be .  spoilers below :  the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree .  they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack .  bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment .  soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed .  bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time .  the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations .  they both discover that they both knew about the flirting .  bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry .  in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects .  bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter .  when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer .  he sees " opportunity " as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted .  as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker .  seeing another " opportunity " arise , he follows the hooker home .  they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone .  he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night .  he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in .  when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded .  bill is intrigued and wants to go to one .  nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password .  what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father .  the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening .  he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair .  after partaking in some strange " religious " right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies .  a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party .  he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group .  after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events .  unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together .  in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died .  i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point .  this is only about 100 minutes at this point .  this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it .  it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film .  it's got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values .  but they all serve to show why they are bad in one's life .  i recommend this film highly on many merits .  cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .

1466	if you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for " wild wild west , " the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck's frappacino or on a ben & jerry's sundae .  these treats are great relief from the summer heat .  in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment .  i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat .  this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat .  in this film , they are no where to be found .  what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula .  two men are asked to stop this threat .  one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents .  among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest .  the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating .  although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act .  for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with .   " now touch my breast , " west says .  gordon does so and then softly coos his approval .  i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness .  the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter .  i did enjoy kline's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith .  could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he's not even required to act ?  it was as if the director was yelling " will smith , do your own thing . . . and  action ! "  here's an example .  in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people .  he must endear himself to the crowd to escape .  the director yells , " will smith , do your own thing . . . and  action ! "  in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades .   " will smith , do your own thing . . . and  action ! "  worse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess .  there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look .  there's actually a lot of imagination at work in this film .  there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat .  and that's too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his 'thing , ' this film might have been palatable .  as it turns out , " wild wild west " is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year .

1471	if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it .  scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch .  it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store .  because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away .  the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems .  clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it .  harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly .  you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn .  the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet .  it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino .  once they get to mexico , it's time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper .  finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire .  soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back .  that's right , we've come all this way to see a vampire movie .  but like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment .  so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes " a lap dog of satan . "  the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest .  clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously .  stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn .  pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment .  from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie .

1476	when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better .  nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .  for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids .  for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .  feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era .  martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .  the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights .  the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world .  the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign .  their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre .  losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street .  he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict .  that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .  as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .  for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .  for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .  brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .  his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .  his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .  however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .  but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against " scum " is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it .  while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .  wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he " knows stuff " .  his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .  other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .  matthew " sport " ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .  porno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly " liberated " betsy .  even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless " messages " that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis .  the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end .  travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen .  new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere .  another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture .  one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason .  instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie .  now , more than two decades later , when some other " life imitating art " incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory .

1482	near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king .  the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia .  at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry .  in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different .  there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged .  dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed .  the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively .  although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner .  unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition .  in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product .  the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date .  the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .  the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot .  namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d .  dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney .  the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent .  for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense .  the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way .  in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything .  moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family .  moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves .  by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention .  the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin .  the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting .  it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost .  but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .

1492	from the mind of robert bloch , of " psycho " fame , come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film , which , while not quite as much fun , or scary , as i would have liked , still provides for some decent genre entertainment . it 's linked by the wrap - around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective ( john bennett ) who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor ; he 's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place , and our film is off and running . " method for murder " has author charles hillyer ( always delightful denholm elliott ) haunted by his latest fictional creation , who has seemingly come to life . this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments , and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement . " waxworks " stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson , who , along with old friend neville rogers ( joss ackland ) becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum . most effective in this episode is the dream sequence , although it 's great as always to watch cushing . the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking . " sweets to the sweet " features another well - loved horror star , christopher lee , as john reid , who does n't treat adorable moppet child jane ( chloe franks ) with too much kindness , and it 's up to new companion / tutor ann norton ( nyree dawn porter ) to find out why . the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently ; the film - makers wisely do n't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family . the " dying " moments are particularly horrific . " the cloak " has the most outright comedy of the four ; jon pertwee , one of many actors to have played the role of dr. who over the years , is a lot of fun as a vain , temperamental horror movie star ( in fact , he 's the highlight of this story ) who , infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low - budget film , goes out and buys his own cloak . said cloak has strange powers , which i dare not reveal here . sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees ' companion ; one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee ! the wrap - up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously . underscored by michael dress 's unusual , striking , and eerie score , " the house that dripped blood " is an entertaining mix of stories ; while i do n't enjoy it quite as much as , say , " tales from the crypt " , it 's still good fun . capably directed by peter duffell , it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions , and is certainly a good film of its type . 7/10
1493	it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
1494	let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .  i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven .  was it any good ?  well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) .  now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker .  i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection .  problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a " true " cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail .  so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ?  truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches .  yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from .  as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos .  as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a " guy " film could potentially bring .  now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?  ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain .  throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! )  into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .  how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ?  so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .  the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at .  since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .   ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .  like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .   ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .  here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) .  williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york .  they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .  and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .  the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice .  danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way .  he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a " double agent " .  he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .  right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .  and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .  undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) .  how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ?  prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat .  lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .  his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking .  lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .  this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching .  though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot .  some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .  hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .  of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on .  for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .  it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies .  there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing .  this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak .  in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .  he's lost his voice .  does that little itty bitty detail matter ?  maybe not to most , but it sure made my night .  and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .  
1495	where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
1496	it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
1497	 " practical magic , " is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one .  the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years .  at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) .  switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) .  when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house .  add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of " light-hearted whimsy , " and you have a pretty good idea how messy " practical magic " is .  after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed .  it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching .  it is not charming or entertaining in any way .  and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body .  whatever .  the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character .  there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side .  no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people .  the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way .  in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines .  i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the " batman " series with " batman forever " and " batman and robin . "   " practical magic " is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , " addicted to love , " with meg ryan and matthew broderick .  i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since " practical magic " is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is .  i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself .  
1498	a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
1499	senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far .  director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies .  marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage .  however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up .  in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet .  but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel .  he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) .  as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold .  using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) .  naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor .  the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here .  the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor .  there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot .  the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous .  i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ?  and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ?  to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) .  apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie .  his " intervention " scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh .  and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one .  in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses .  needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film .  this is a film that desperately needed something else .  be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground .  as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .

1503	i had the privilege of watching " holly " at the edinburgh film festival last week . what a powerful and moving story ! holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia . patrick ( an american ) comes into holly 's life and decides he wants to help her . when holly is sold again , patrick desperately searches for her . we follow they 're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion . holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day . the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line . i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help ? this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore .

1508	ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
1509	after the huge success of " the exorcist " in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely .  needless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with .  to start the " story " it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) .  now they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan's body , before it is too late .  some of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn't go anywhere .  louise fletcher is alright for what it's worth , but she could have done a lot better than this .  the direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn't figure out .  in fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad .  for those exorcist fans who haven't seen this one , i recommend renting it .  i actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else !  im not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere .  bad , bad , bad movie .

1512	way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad .  one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance .  after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his " target " .  it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate .  but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty .  here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his " look here , see " glory .  it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion .  unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that .  as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man .  the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed .  but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit .  directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity .  unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it .  the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is .  it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life .  even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously " dramatic " .  usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending .  nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential .  thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled .  however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason .  or substance .  it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be .  even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like " karma is only justice with out the satisfaction " are clever .  at one point caan laments " need is the ultimate monkey " a line so inexplicable he might as well have said " love is like hippo ass " .  i've seen porno with better dialogue .  and some with better plot lines too .  but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) .  caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness .  benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering .  speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose .  nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence .  taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene .  for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns .  it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about " faggots " migrating to los angeles .  you know the routine .  the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at .  but those gun shots sure crack like thunder .  just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson .  oh how far we've come .

1514	[a] strong piece of work . 
1515	this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be " one of the hottest writers in hollywood " .  he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 )  script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series " dawson's creek " .  so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said " sure , go for it ! " .  uhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ?  plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college .  when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman .  critique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks .  this movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles .  i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr .  zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate .  he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue .  sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs . tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! ) .  all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend .  no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater .  if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning .  little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman .  kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's " dawson's creek " , a show kevin created .  he was once an aspiring actor .  in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's " another world " .  also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book " killing mr . griffin " by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) ,  lois duncan .  he has also come out and said that he is a gay man .  helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff .  she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  this film was originally titled killing mrs .  tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident .  actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called " wasteland " .  this is actor barry watson first full feature film .  he has played the character of " seth " on tv's " malibu shores " several times .

1519	here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop .  okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart .  most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them .  however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered .  a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash .  but , the thing is , it isn't .  it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent .  i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film .  but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements .  it's about how much it can get into one film .  and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so .  species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe .  many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs .  species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars .  aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut .  patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed .  well , it would seem that he has succeeded .  landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so .  of course , he isn't the first ever .  about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life .  now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky .  no life lives on it .  that is , no visible life .  patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground .  he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage .  unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship .  just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings .  they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember .  they blame it on a technical malfunction .  back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible .  as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet .  however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is .  patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) .  eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien .  however , this time around , most of her " alien " urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant .  the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable .  since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again .  and it has .  story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) .  what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay .  in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles .  this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) .  the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot .  beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie .  and it does it quite well .  the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do .  the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does .  there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects .  the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad .  but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) .  also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off .  however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary .  many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence .  however , i tend to disagree .  what were the alien films about ?  and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ?  my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .  i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .  the acting is quite good for this kind of film .  it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least .  the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens .  okay , so it isn't that good .  george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting .  natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage .  however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent .  oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch .  marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film .  michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) .  james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor .  as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability .  mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel .  and , of course , justin lazard .  lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective .  sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ?  the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting .  species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language .  this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see .  more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives .  hell , i don't even know if i will .  what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year .  i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while .  director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series .  medak has also mastered the wonderful " jump ! "  moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) .  strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .

1545	synopsis : blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses to copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs .  in the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat .  comments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film .  one wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( " saturday night live " ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey .  not only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it .  what was she thinking ?  never talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial .  she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood .  two men woo her ; tony the " security consultant " wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) .  a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings .  86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours .  a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony .  why would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ?  that's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered .  regardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism .  they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) .  also , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex .  the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's " character development . "  someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) .  rotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her .  suspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die .  oftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) .  sarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within .  suspense at its very derivative !  as stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible .  comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much .  maybe , in a way , he's lucky for that .  early on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers .  allow me to advise that you never watch this stinker .  
1546	this is a deliriously colossal vulgar silly all star extravaganza revue of all the early talkie stars that warner bros could afford . ... and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late 20s , an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring twenties ' exuberance and youthfulness put to song and dance . the show of shows is pretty gigantic . vaudeville act after soliloquy after tap dance after acrobat after comedian after fan - dance after ukulele lunacy after rin tin tin who introduces ' an oriental number ' ... ( ! ) ... and on and on it lumbers , grinning and squeaking away in fabulous gramophone quality vitaphone sound . it is far too long , but among it 's delirious delights are the awesome " singin in the bathtub " number created on a scale of which the qe2 architects would be proud ... beatrice lillie lounging by a grand piano with some happiness boys amusingly warbling a witty ditty , nick lucas , and the never - ending grand finale in two color color ... which is all set to the song lady luck . . so keen are the tubby chorus line and leaping teenagers to en - ter - tain us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort . row after row of " doll " characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor . i kid you not , there are even girls strapped to the crystal chandeliers , mummified with shiny gauze and chained up with pearl ropes , unable to move ( for days , i imagine , during production ) whilst this katzenjammer of toy - box athleticism twitch and spasm below to the ukulele orchestra . of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to horrify and terrify them each separately and to roll about on the lounge in shrieking in delight at each and every exclamation of their startled reactions . and so should you ... and rejoice that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill . it is all so demented .
1547	where to begin ? how about with the erroneous synopsis :   " x - men origins : wolverine tells the story of wolverine 's epically violent and romantic past , his complex relationship with victor creed , and the ominous weapon x program . " his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non - violent . his relationship with creed is so glossed over it 's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all . we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run , to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan , and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins . there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all . nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving .   the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt . we are thrown into a romance so fast that it 's over before you can blink an eye . having just introduced the character , silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later . we are left wondering why we should care about this . who was she anyway ? for a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story , the romance is surprisingly unexplored . it was rushed in simply because it was required . oddly enough , when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth . being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise . as for the weapon x program , lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running . eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple . surprisingly ma and pa kent are n't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn . is it any wonder what fate awaits them ? in the previous films and the comic books , the main reason that wolverines ' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded . knowing this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates ? as hinted to in x2 : x - men united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together . this film sets up the team fairly well only they do n't really do much of anything . no disturbing violence , no ruthless actions , they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen .   it seems that wolverine was n't an evil man under stryker at all . instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was . eventually he just leaves all together . no conflict of duality here at all . idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely . they may as well have given him rubber claws . there were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the x - men trilogy , including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit a script . magic memory - erasing bullets .   really ? apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine . yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all . another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all . interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story . most were in the film for 5 - 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine . fred dukes ( the blob but not the comic version ) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him ? cyclops optic beams ( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers ) can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes . adamantium trench coats anyone ? the ( gravity defying ) mutant gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat . in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine ... then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running towards wolverine . how he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained . some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash . the idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect . the comic book source material , the real origin of wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen . it does n't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies . it is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with weapon x by barry windsor - smith . a much more intense and exciting story . this fox film should seriously be forgotten .   anyone have that magic gun ?

1551	if anything , " stigmata " should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another .  of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst .  i suppose i should have seen this coming .  after all , " blair witch " thoroughly creeped me out , " sixth sense " was mildly spooky , and then " stir of echoes " had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over .  clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping .  is it then any surprise that " stigmata " is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ?  no , not really .  patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother .  as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest .  the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue .  father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue .  his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ .  father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on .  he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church .  as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a " fifth gospel " before they were excommunicated .  the new rupert wainwright music video .   .   .  i mean film " stigmata " is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse .  indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes .  i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school .  his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing .  what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , " see ?  look at what i can do !  i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . "  maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) .  if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it .  just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .  arrrrrrrghhhh .   .   .  then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if " stigmata " had a story or characters that were remotely engaging .  though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script .  where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ?  case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her .  the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !  the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either .  according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ?  go clubbing !  sure , that makes sense .  arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking .  scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable .  even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon .  even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances .  father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .  as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , " i'll get you , my pretty , " for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded .  trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain .  what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .  first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ?  how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ?  actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by .  supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) .  which one is it ?  the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .  furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .  if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library .  there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though .   " stigmata's " religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church .  if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting .  i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means .  it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as " stigmata " does .  it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be .  i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .  maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .  the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over .  like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill .  so much is overdone in " stigmata , " that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws .  i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .  when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing .  the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and " stigmata " is it .

1554	after the recent animated debacles of , " a rugrats movie , " and " a bug's life , " i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks' other insect film from october , " antz . "  i hated that movie , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excursions .   " a bug's life , " is the second animated insect film in the last two months , and i hoped for the best , considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar's last film , 1995's " toy story , " but in no way does , " a bug's life , " even remotely match up to that .  flik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with his many comrades , has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest , only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) .  flik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees .  banished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) .   " a bug's life , " has one thing going for it .  only one thing .  with its glorious , bright colors , the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at .  the film itself , unfortunately , is a lifeless , unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of , " toy story . "  the characters in , " a bug's life , " are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality , other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners .  the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes , and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout , and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler .  after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year , i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them , but then i realized this is just not so .  i still adore almost all of the older disney films , and many of the newer ones , such as 1989's , " the little mermaid , " 1991's , " beauty and the beast , " 1993's , " the nightmare before christmas , " and yes , 1995's , " toy story . "  maybe this has just been a bad year for children's films , and hopefully , the upcoming , " the prince of egypt , " will not be a disappointment .  as for , " a bug's life , " i did not enjoy anything about it .  not the story , not the characters , and not even the voiceover work , which was far more lively in , " antz . "   " a bug's life , " goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , " i'll be home for christmas . "

1560	the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin .  both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations .  in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and " rambo " -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures .  spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead .  though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) .  he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon .  but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death .  typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video .  while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold .  but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) .  so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel .  while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power .  spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie .

1575	i'm not really sure what to think about " crash . "  on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork .  i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out .  but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained .   " crash " is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue .  while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization .  not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed .  but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience .  this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of " henry and june " or the just plain horniness of , say , " deep throat " ( not that i've seen it ) .  if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole " auto eroticism " thing .  the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge .  the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of " the game " ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar .  suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) .  the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie .  the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades .  while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge .  soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on .  james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive .  the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again .  when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident .  you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it .  vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes .  in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) .  soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex .  while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge .  i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex .  the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush .  his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp .  then when it happens , we hold our breath .  the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion .  these people are merely taking it to another level .  the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant .  a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half .  this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long .  the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side .  there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize .  but still , they coulda cut it down a bit .  but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements .  the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling .  and there are several scenes are just amazing .  one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it .  a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs .  and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded .  the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) .  while james spader is pretty boring ( he's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing .  she speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she's enjoying it or not .  in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her .  holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) .  but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone .  he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life .  he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he's getting a freaky tatoo .  he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene .  kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in " teenage mutant ninja turtles " ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he's capable of bigger roles .  while i hardly enjoyed " crash , " it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world .  these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out .  despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there's also an r-rated version , but i wouldn't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno .  
1576	an already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus . if only there were one for this kind of movie . 
1577	because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !  at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources !  the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of " the x-files . "  bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident .  at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant .  grace gets elizabeth's heart , and it leads her to bob .  it's the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people .  four writers are credited with contributing to the story .  that doesn't seem possible .  despite being a solid two hours long , " return to me " adds little to the " boy meets girl / boy loses girl " formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving .  duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along .  since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny .  he's out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i've always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on " the x-files " comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) .  there's something about duchovny that makes me uneasy .  regardless of the role he's playing , he comes off as a weirdo .  the only redeeming quality of " return to me " is its hilarious supporting cast .  the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie .  carroll o'connor is grace's grandfather marty o'reilly .  when bob comes into marty's restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status .  when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , " this is bob !  his wife is dead ! "  the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news .  also funny : bonnie hunt as grace's best friend megan and james belushi as megan's husband joe .  married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance .  although it's rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill .  rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob's best friend and robert loggia as marty's brother-in-law angelo .  in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast .  bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o'connor and james belushi .

1586	one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise .   " spy kids " certainly did .  an adventure story aimed primarily at children , the movie is smart , zippy fun .  the production neither panders nor talks down to its audience .  the brother and sister at the center of the tale are believable , likable kids and their parents are ? get ready for this ? intelligent , capable and loving .  bathroom humor is kept to a minimum and the numerous well-staged action scenes avoid excessive violence .  what a relief it is to be able to review an all-ages film on its artistic merits and not its ethics .  consider the other pg rated " family friendly " movie in theaters now .   " see spot run " has a mother going out of town , leaving her son with an idiot neighbor .  body function humor abounds , including a slapstick bit that has the adult male lead repeatedly falling in dog poop .  what really disturbs me are the jokes that bookend the film .  the story begins with a police dog capturing a mobster and biting off one of his testicles in the process .  at the hospital , the doctors explain that they replaced the testicle with a metal ball and joke that the victim is lucky the dog didn't bit off the other one , because two metal replacement balls would clack together .  of course , the movie ends with the dog biting off the remaining testicle and shows prisoners laughing at the criminal as he clacks past their cells .  somebody clue me in ? when did genital mutilation become funny ?   " spy kids " is a welcome antidote to the repellent " see spot run , " using imagination instead of cruelty and crudeness .  carmen ( alexa vega ) and her younger brother juni ( daryl sabara ) live in a beautiful seaside home with their parents , gregorio ( antonio banderas ) and ingrid cortez ( carla gugino ) .  mom and dad are a sultry couple devoted to their children .  what the kids don't know is that they are also former spies .  once agents from different countries assigned to " erase " each other , they instead fell in love , married and retired to raise a family .  needless to say , they get drawn back to the business .  shortly into their first joint mission , they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) , a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show .  but there is evil behind the scenes , as inventors prepare an army of robots disguised as children .  papa gregorio has the device necessary to radically increase the efficiency of the creatures and the bad guys will stop at nothing to get it from him .  back at home , " uncle " felix ( cheech marin ) shows up to reveal mom and dad's secret to the kids .  after a brief respite at a safe house filled with enough cool gadgets for a dozen sharper image stores , carmen and juni set off to find their parents and save the world , zooming through the sea in a submarine pod that looks like a goldfish , while a slew of wicked people ( including teri hatcher ) chase them .  during the course of their adventures , they get to use jet packs , electroshock bubblegum and super-computer sunglasses .  they watch as secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with silly putty faces and used as background characters on floop's tv show .  they deal with guards that have huge thumbs where their arms , legs and heads would normally be ( why are the guards so ineffective ?  because they're all thumbs ! )  they move from one colorful locale to another , including a nifty virtual reality room reminiscent of the holodeck from " star trek . "  the storyline is silly and convoluted , but even at its most dense , it is easier to follow than either " mission : impossible " movie .  director robert rodriguez ( " from dusk to dawn " ) maintains a frenetic pace , with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes .  a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice , but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family .  alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team , squabbling the way kids do , but coming together when it counts .  antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes .  even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments ? a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film .  had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that , i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) .  regardless , " spy kids " is a hoot , offering fun for adults and children alike .  and just think , they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle .  
1587	it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of " the horse whisperer , " the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to " projection difficulties . "  robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with " titanic , " but is only now making its much anticipated debut .  this ( strategic ? )  delay has allowed " the horse whisperer " to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office .  no matter .  redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments .  whatever the reasons for its postponement , " the horse whisperer " supports the old adage " better late than never . "  redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment .  while parts of " the horse whisperer " are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial " travelogue " that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .  when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim .  refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too .  undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal .  redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds .  the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints .  redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role .  dianne wiest , chris cooper ( " lone star " ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast .  and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence .  one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing .  redford's canvas is huge and exquisite .  he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder .  veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since " the horse whisperer " is " dances with wolves " by way of " out of africa " ( oscar winners both for barry ) .  fortunately , barry's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance .   " the horse whisperer " is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good .  the wait , it turns out , was well worth it .

1589	this could n't have been better . the strong restraints on mike sullivan 's expressions could n't have been portrayed in any other way . tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career . young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story . and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time . this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner . this is a father / son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . mike sullivan had no father as a child , so john rooney took him in . although a generous man , mr. rooney involved himself in organized crime . therefore , the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . now , sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . the events to follow , will test sullivan 's loyalty and embrace his family 's fate . with a great adaptation by david self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930 's setting ( brilliant art direction by richard l. johnson & nancy haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . driving the story , is thomas newman 's wonderful irish score , settling in only when necessary . but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l. hall 's beautiful photography . this is some of the best cinematography i 've seen ; and i watch a lot of films . the scene when mike and michael are in the car , entering chicago is quite impressive . the shot starts at the front of the car , revealing mike(hanks ) through the windshield . it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see michael(hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . as it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930 's chicago . with a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . i 'm talking about sam mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty . ( won him various awards ) before american beauty , mendes worked as a play director for the british theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . with only two films , sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( in a list of about twenty - five ) . the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . the photography , acting and story is phenominal . i 'm still waiting for scorcesee 's gangs of new york , but for now , i 'm fully confident in saying that this is the " best film of the year " . considering it 's competition ( signs , insomnia , minority report ) that s a strong statement .

1596	historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s .  for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects .  but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .  and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with " oscars " .  the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .  the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .  in his time , english king edward i " longshanks " ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by " ius primae noctis " and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .  although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .  murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .  through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .  but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .  braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .  however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .  the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .  while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .  this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .  compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .  braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .  what makes braveheart " larger than life " is his protagonist .  mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .  wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .  naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .  however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .  because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .  mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .  most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .  brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .  david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .  women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .  catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .  from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .  photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .  on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .  although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .  the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of " longshank " 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .  he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in " politically correct " hollywood .  to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .  however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .  according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .  this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .  in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .  
1597	i must say , i thought i had seen it all . i am an extremely jaded movie buff . this movie did n't shock me , by any means . i 'm way past that point . but it did take me to certain emotional places i did n't know i could go to . i had no idea i could ever find ( ick ) the idea of beastiality erotic . never never never . ever . ever . but there you go . he did it . i have to give the director credit . he pulled it off . for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore . we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie was n't a mistake . then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . then some nervous guy shaves . then we see ( briefly ) a hot chick getting it on with a butler ( but this is very brief ) . at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . in fact , i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night . we finally get the good stuff when a girl ( who knows who she is , or who anyone is in this movie ) has a dream about a victorian - era gal being ravaged by a beast - thing in the forest . the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat ( heh - heh ) of the whole deal . it 's beautifully shot , superbly edited , and does deliver the goods . they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of does n't either . oh well . i would definitely recommend this film . the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself ( and my tv ) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it .
1598	spoilers   well , the one line summary says it all . melville´s " le samurai " is the original and there are elements of " leon " . and they are better - much better ! in the " samurai " alain delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs ( with so much suspense in these scenes ! ) . even the end is exactly the same : the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it . delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog . but i guess jarmusch liked " leon " very much or even " desperado " by rodriguez . so he added this , too . and let me guess : the girl will become a professional like ghost dog ( like natalie portman in " leon " ) ? so what was jarmusch thinking after all ? where is the unique , the original thought in this movie ? i can´t see the point in making carbon ( celluloid ) copies . a 4/10 rating by macaulay connor

1616	it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback .  of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there .  payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin .  the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet .  all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences .  it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters .  obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers .  porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val .  gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants .  you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) .  harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ?  this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se .  while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are .  porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable .  payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done .  the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ?  the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies .  the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes .  a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation .  just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .

1620	nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy .  however half baked doesn't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more .  the plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners .  there's the group's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams ) .  kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse .  when the animal keels over , he finds himself accused of killing a police officer , and facing a $1 , 000 , 000 bail .  his friends promise to raise money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how .  that is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor .  soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii ) .  for a comedy , the film is pretty humorless .  not that it doesn't try . . . it's  just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat .  the four leads are nearly all playing the same character .  only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) .  to help out , the film is packed full of cameos .  steven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another .  none of them work , beyond the simple " hey , that's _____ " level .  in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle .  not as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot .  granted , it's pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren't a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up .  to top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) .  her role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong .  her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the " your film promotes the use of drugs " camp .  the film would have been better off by sticking with the " rebel " tone it so eagerly tries to claim .  yet , in the end , it doesn't really matter .  watching the film clean and sober , you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is .

1631	steve soderbergh's " sex , lies , and videotape , " which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films .  made on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama .  the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's .  ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) .  complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house .  ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex .  that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , " sex , lies , and videotape , " it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise .  director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's " out of sight " ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's " schizopolis " ) .  he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , " sex , lies , and videotape , " is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date .  the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character .  she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , " short cuts " ) .  the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia .  the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets .  suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception .  the film has one fault , however .  the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable .  if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked .   " sex , lies , and videotape , " although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film .  soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this .

1633	gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made .  so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ?  first of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive .  also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising .  last of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance .  i mean , the guy can't be that untalented , can he ?  the answer to that question is three letters long .  nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles .  since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent , it's hard to describe the plot .  let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls .  the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star .  he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans .  this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming .  it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez .  i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft .  he works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes .  halfway through the film , i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation .  then as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions .  it's sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face " i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do " attitude .  the performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn't saying much .  at least we don't have to suffer jonathan " i am the most hideous man in america " schaech .  we are , however treated to another round of james " i'm more wooden than keanu " duval .  sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film , and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki's wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess .  of the tv star cameos , john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist .  if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation , it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture .  maybe greg arraki doesn't want you to like his characters .  maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them .  maybe he just wanted to piss me off .  if so , he was successful .

1639	modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome .  adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen .  liam neeson stars as jean valjean .  as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes .  prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor .  however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man .  however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform .  inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider .  he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions .  he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice .  two women also get caught up in the struggle .  fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society .  her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her .  instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave .  director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book .  hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went .  the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes .  the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles .  neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past .  the supporting cast is also extraordinary .  the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius .  the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film .  the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length .  while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation .  it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .

1643	i read a couple of good reviews on this board for " mr. scarface " , but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of italian gangster films like myself , the picture will probably make very little sense . indeed , after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam , the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of rick 's ( al cliver ) character . the whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of vinchenzo napoli ( vittorio caprioli ) , but as most other viewers commented , he 's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence . i found it somewhat unbelievable that manzari 's goons who chased tony through the streets did n't actually stroke out before tony even laid a hand on them . for all of his buildup as the title character , jack palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale , making the u.s. working title , " mr. scarface " , rather moot . i 've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that they do n't all work ; i guess in this case , my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick did n't quite make it either .
1644	hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
1645	movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films of the past .  so , undoubtedly one day someone said , " 'evolution ? '  it's 'ghostbusters' plus 'men in black' plus 'tremors . ' "  and so it is .  sum total none .  the alienbusting begins when a meteor lands in glen canyon , arizona .  community college science profs ira kane ( david duchovny ) and harry block ( orlando jones ) take some samples from the meteor and discover that one-celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly , doing in hours what took millions of years for life on earth .  just about the time i was wondering , " hey , doesn't the government usually come in and take over the whole area in these movies , " the government came in and took over the whole area .  the leader of the pack , gen . woodman ( ted levine ) , turns out to be an old nemesis of ira's , and ira and harry are blocked from doing further research .  meanwhile , the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people .  by this time , ira and harry have gained a friend in dr . allison reed ( julianne moore ) of the center for disease control .  a country club poolboy , wayne green ( seann william scott ) , has also attached himself to the merry band .  but can they find the means to stop the aliens in time ?  director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984's " ghostbusters , " but " evolution " falls miserably short .  one reason is readily apparent .   " ghostbusters " had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but " evolution " has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else's hands .  for good measure , " ghostbusters " had the comic talents of rick moranis ; " evolution " offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in " american pie " and " road trip " than he is here .  scott has one amusing scene where he sings " you are so beautiful to me " to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap .  other than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him .  an actor in search of a forte , david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in " playing god " and his romantic side in " return to me . "  now he wants to find his wacky comedic talent ; what we all find is that he doesn't have any .  look for him to be back on tv in five years or so .  another sad case is julianne moore , who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts .  she's a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations , so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy ?  her character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things , but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs .  the sole saving grace of the film is jones .  he's at the center of the movie's funniest scene -- where an alien bug invades harry's body and has to be pulled out through his ass .  jones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it , but he can't carry the whole movie by himself .  he found himself in a similar situation in " the replacements , " where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast .  jones will eventually find the project that will make him a major comedy star , but this isn't it .

1650	susan granger's review of " the closet " ( miramax films )  in this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory .  lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide .  but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management .  as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss .  when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man .  his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences .  even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain .  but not everyone is enchanted .  a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job .  writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia .  daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 .  it's so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles .

1656	lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by .  most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot .  perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about .  the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level .  it's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back .  although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun .  that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed .  enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie .  enemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch .  the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) .  reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee .  reynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera .  by an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies .  it's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things .  the acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around .  smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role .  smith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not .  the supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas .  this is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking .

1659	when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space .  it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver .  but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks .  if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ?  -- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex .  even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery .  the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody .  all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america .  ironically , powers' " yeeeeah baby , yeah ! "  has almost become an icon of the late 90s .  thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome .  the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life .  it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones .  austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen .  he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again .  surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin .  he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie .  perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately .  instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe .  the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more .  by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites .  even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like " do you smoke after sex ? "   " i don't know , baby , i never looked . "  this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny .  i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious " just the two of us " rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named " mini-me " .  i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort .  indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did .  but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough .   ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ;

1665	majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
1666	britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
1667	an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
1668	a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
1669	among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade .  those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star .  as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression .  the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) .  however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) .  one stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder .  however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end .  belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots .  unfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional .  the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them .  the actors that play them don't help either .  that is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison .  his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents .  ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

1671	not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
1672	i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic - comedy i have ever seen . it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation . the thought that maybe they wo n't get together ... it is an indie film after all . this movie was well written , directed and acted . the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent .
1673	the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
1674	the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
1675	alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise .

1677	 " . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . "  - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein .  kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale .  the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful .  but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story .  horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror .  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches .  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel .  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean .  the year is 1794 .  a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters .  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs .  as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon .  it's a man .  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew .  his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown .  the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .  he is remembering his childhood and youth .  laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns .  here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony .  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed .  like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother .  shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death .  standing on his mother's grave he says : " oh mother . . you  did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i  will stop this . . i  promiss . . "  after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career .  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death .  composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally .  with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation .  the result was ugliness .  realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late .  the creature has escaped .  because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding .  for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death .  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . .  whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel .  brannagh has more or less done that .  another thing is characters and actors .  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast .  the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro .  alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness .  at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .  later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge .  he is capable of killing without regret .   " i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and  then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and  as i killed him , i saw your face . . "  that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator .  and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : " for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . "  rarely has a cinematic interpretation of " the daemon " approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel .  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein .  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm .  almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel .  here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene .  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character .  on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past .  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart .  the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing .  visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) .  the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold .  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : " . . all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by  my hand . . " .  and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire .  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness .  and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face .  can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ?  to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ?  shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them .  following her example , branagh does the same .  his film is a tragic saga about playing god .  victor frankenstein is not an evil man .  he wanted to change the world to the better .  in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions .  produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film " dracula " .  in comparison , i can say that " dracula " has visuals that even " frankenstein " can not live up to .  but when it comes to story , characters and casting , " frankenstein " is stronger .  but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's " interview with the vampire " .  although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating .  branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .  
1678	urban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didn't suspect !  however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .  the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and " cybil " actress alicia witt ) .  or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .  i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem , though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .  naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .  i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca

1682	plot : a rich guy who doesn't believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself .  that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter .  but what's this ?  one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ?  wow . . . a  sin , indeed .  critique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year .  too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie .  what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ?   ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience .  have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ?  well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! !  i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ?  okay , so where do i start ?  first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal .  so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two " lovers " go through the motions until the " betrayal " occurs .  whoopee , big surprise .  second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part .  why ?  well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman !  i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here .  every look in jolie's eyes screams " psycho " !  then of course , you have the case of the " patsy " husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time .  i mean . . . how  boring is that for the audience ?  you're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude .  no , thanks !  and if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ?  well , i'll tell you .  the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled .  no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending .  so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ?  well , it's actually pretty simple .  i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record ) .  everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid .  try imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but  without the plot !  that's pretty much what you've got here .  a low point in the careers of both stars .  oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god  oh mighty . . . make  it stop ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 )

1691	a cutesy romantic tale with a twist . 
1692	i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws .  but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american .  or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence .  this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role .  if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work .  although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself .  this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) .  in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind .  it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail .  it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful .  yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch .  he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison .  his cell , food and rights  all terrible .  now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder .  jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .   as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered .  red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes .  what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .  this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption .  but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch .  if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible .  it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before .  if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions .  shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself .  taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be .  although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway .  whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again .  martin vailwhere are you ?

1700	the cartoon is way better .  that's the bottom line on disney's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature .  the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic " home alone " with puppies , and not much else .  when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be " why ?  the original cartoon still works , so what's the point ? "  the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign .  the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple .  two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight .  they drag their " human pets " together , and in a short time both couples marry .  the heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy's new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts .  everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies .  in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities .  we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog's view of humans as their pets .  in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless .  hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks .  while he drew the desired " aww , they're so cute " reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering " i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog's heads to get them licking like that ? "  the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little .  joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles .  in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona .  in " something wild " , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor .  in " terms of endearment " , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer .  here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film .  glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality .  as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance .  close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself .  with a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature .  she's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious .  when she spits out lines like " you've won the battle , but i'm about to win the wardrobe ! , "  the film comes briefly to life .   " 101 dalmatians " is crammed with john hughes' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy .  after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on .  the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence .   " 101 dalmatians " has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another .  rent the cartoon !

1715	 " tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! "  a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands .  it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance .  indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times .  no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year .  in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : " mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! " .  executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late .  mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history .  unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature .  based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother .  if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania .  the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will .  joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see .  but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end .  the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum .  frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving .  in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters .  when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions .  crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain .  you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers .  ah , but there is dunaway's performance .  and what a delicious piece of campery it often is .  having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden .  she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making .  spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line " tina ! !  fetch me the axe ! ! "  with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling .  in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers .  oh dear !  sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ?  this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : " no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! " .  and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : " don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! " .  oh joy !  something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it .  better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .  great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .  
1716	this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . ever . but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd 's at my local pound shop . me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . it soon occurred that this was n't any normal film . instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill 's last film . at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no - one could be bothered . instead we watched the film right through . at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this was n't a work of abysmal film . this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . this was a film that anyone can enjoy . this was genius .

1723	beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made , yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes ( and to be honest that 's all you need to see ) combine to create something that is hilariously side - splitting . the opening scene in ' space ' is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets , as washing - up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue . before you 've had time to work out whether it 's you who 's gone mad , the credits roll and the action struggles to life . and aside from the double - headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes , you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time . pure genius . the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i 've only ever seen one copy , so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely . perhaps i own the only copy in existence .

1733	as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens , i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels .  but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers , i can't say that i do exactly .  her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed , so therefor she does not believe .  ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist .  how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite ?  that's the catch-22 .  when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they didn't really * fax * them . . . )  ellie wants to be the one to go , but because of her atheism she is denied the position .  how dumb is that ?  she discovers the transmitions , then she isn't allowed to go .  well , because of a bomb and a psychopath ( jake busey ) , she * does * end up going , but not in the way that we would've thought .  contact is based on a novel by carl sagan , who died during the filmmaking .  it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind , and will end up being the best film of the year .  its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some , but will stimulate more .  i'm glad at least one movie of the '90s can portray aliens in a psitive light , rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body .

1745	this show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between " pushing daisies " style and anyone else 's was not a steal . ( yes , i 've seen " amelie . " " pushing daisies " is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original . ) rather , there are too few shows on tv that have this kind of quirky charm . the greatest similarity is to " dead like me " but " p.d " comes by that similarity honestly : bryan fuller created both shows . ( both shows involve an " undead " young woman , for example . ) this show never stopped being funny and charming , and it was always odd , yet was consistently humane . i must say a word about the conventions of on - going story lines . some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first ( and several subsequent ) episodes ned seems to get away with causing the death of chuck 's father without consequences of any kind . first of all , this must be a new definition of " without consequences of any kind " because , in spite of the fact that ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of chuck 's father , he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done . further , about a dozen episodes into the series , ned finally did confess to chuck that he had caused her father 's death with his gift . now , there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person 's death by bringing another person back to life , so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance . in other words , it 's between ned and chuck , who was not inclined to forgive ned anytime soon . but this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas . i remember when david caruso 's character on " nypd blue " did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it -- for a whole year -- then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job ( and left the show ) . the point is , viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode , and is not caught in that episode , that he has gotten away with it . there is always next week -- and maybe even next year .

1754	it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death .  after having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well .  one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement .  there is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' .  in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) .  so what are the lessons learnt : 1 .  don't take your children to class reunions .  2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second .  michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' .  my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively .  whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop .  lastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind .

1760	in the finale of disney's " mighty joe young , " a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground .  upon impact , rugged everyman and perennial do-gooder bill paxton rushes in , containing the emotional crowd with an earnest " move along now folks , there's nothing to see here . "  ok , so those aren't exactly the words he uses , but it's probably one of the few clich ? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies , " king kong . "  1949's " mighty joe young " was an update of that classic creature feature , also based on merian c . cooper's original story ( 16 years after " 'kong " it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable ) .  now some 49 years later , at least according to disney's way of thinking , the world is ready for one more .  not so .  the only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects .  and these , unfortunately , run hot and cold .  today's joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker , who has been wowing audiences with his state-of-the-art make-up effects since 1971's " schlock " ( which , incidentally , featured a baker-enhanced " gorilla " ) .  joe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit .  while there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker's had a lot of practice with simian effects , after all , including " gorillas in the mist , " " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes , " and the 1976 remake of " king kong " --there's also some surprising cheesiness .  one of the film's most embarrassing moments is when paxton's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from " the lost world : jurassic park " ) .  paxton jubilantly extols the beast's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt .  also , if the film's producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn't have paraded female lead charlize theron ( " trial & error " ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrobe of spaghetti-strapped tops .  even joe seems distracted at times .  the film piles on the clich ? s like there's no tomorrow , including the predictable plot ( anthro-zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l . a . where urban havoc is inevitably wrought ) , predictable villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace ) , predictable love story ( bill and charlize--surprise ! ) , and predictable denouement ( " 'twas box-office receipts that killed the beast " ) .  kids raised on " men in black " ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( " tremors " ) underwood's outing a little lame by comparison .  while certainly better than 1978's " king kong lives " ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , " mighty joe young " proves how the mighty keep falling .  
1761	most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts .  my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies .  i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years .  so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of .  unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through .  those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life .  those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one .  in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before .  toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present .  many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture .  antz , however , has upped the ante considerably .  disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal .  by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films .  but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared .  in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios .  in 1997 , it was the volcano duel .  in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality .  volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations .  in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films .  first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact .  but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) .  who will prevail ?  time will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear .  this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story .  but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version .  some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film .  sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd .  the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended .  this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents .  antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug .  z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker .   " when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . " he comments about his neglected childhood .  one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life .  in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown .  bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader .  after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony .  in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants .  but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her .  he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed .  the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony .  meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him .  so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites .  the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence .  however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence .  the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia .  there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants .  the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass .  looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) .  the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground .  visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline .  but don't be fooled . . .  little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it .  after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again .  hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel .  as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date .  visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come .  the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity .  they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible .  one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball .  the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball .  however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe .  it's truly a great example of film making at its finest .  with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices .  the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) .  at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . .  do they ? ) .  barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body .  young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) .  disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation .  if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) .  vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story .  in fact , it far exceeds that one .  woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years .  without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing .  in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines .  sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress .  sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star .  after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is .  gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona .  christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns .  anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless .  danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job .  dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd .  jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either .  many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman .  he played miles on the tv show murphy brown .  this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses .  of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also .  directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) .  but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture .  tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals .  the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults .  kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor .  most of it will go over young children's heads .  does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ?  not at all .  they will have a lot of fun watching this one .  what is great is the themes that are given to us .  part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community .  thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects .  antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action .  sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home .  the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death .  and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight .  but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters .  i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home .  have i confused you enough ?  if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most .

1765	a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth . i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish : high anxiety , the cheap detective , the black bird , don't look now we're being shot at .......... and have no profile at all today . norman was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it , laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again . famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film , an experiment at the time , norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today . if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either . it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong . just as it should be . in fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .

1775	pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is " sex " , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review .  because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of " sex " ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to " sex " .  i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review .  though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what .  body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack .  it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it .  these are things we all do , sometimes .  the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts .  their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed .  it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek .  at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition .  michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say .  his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera .  they voice simplistic platitudes like " i like to come " or " sex without love equals violence " .  huh ?  and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get .  the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more .  the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events .  we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy .  i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot .  i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others .  with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin .  i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( " sex without love equals violence " ) .  in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning .  the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me .  this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining .  if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side .  additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness .  or realism .  one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters .  they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real .  it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter .  every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner .  body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film .  it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it .  the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow .  the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred .  the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off .  this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street .  unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off .  paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded .  it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision .  the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them .  he gave them heart .  cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones .  he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us .  this is not the way to get any message across .  why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ?  cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .  
1776	a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
1777	don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .

1779	i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both . the movie , more than the book , made me come close to tears on several occasions . this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go . i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible . i give it ten stars .

1781	i'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft .  seriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off .  the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue .  an example : " that [car crash] must've been awful . . . for  everyone involved . "  you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what .  i know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don't mind cardboard cutouts , but please don't let the cutouts be so damn bland .  one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters .  aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren't on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade .  alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot .  good thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he's only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he's just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo's nest .  which brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it's unoriginality .  the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven's and williamson's great success ) .  urban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn't quite succeed .  it's best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at " that girl in the noxzeema ad " ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from :  female protagonist : why ?  villain : why ?  why ? ! ?  congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend .  like i said , this movie could've been great .  if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script .  still , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer .

1786	countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally .  luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation .  otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer .  in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans .  in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times .  those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery .  the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film .  like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since .  perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away .  or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before .  anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life .  and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic .  star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) .  it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema .  until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , " personal " or " artsy " movies .  as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen .  george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue .  the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood .  serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of " blockbuster " philosophy .  one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre .  until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain .  in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey .  but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies .  however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it .  as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s .  after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment .  ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of " new hollywood " generation of young movie authors who made " artsy " and " personal " films in early 1970s .  george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti .  both movies were considered " personal " in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular .  in a sense , star wars is an also very " personal " film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it .  but unlike many " personal " movies of the era , its " personality " was in line with the wishes of the general audience .  the plot , set " a long time ago , in a galaxy far away " , begins in a time of civil war .  the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic .  in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets .  the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser .  princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) .  those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot .  his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) .  old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force .  after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force .  their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) .  critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of " new hollywood " , are prone to point the lack of originality .  on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress .  on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .  the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .  even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art .  george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup .  characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster .  we have a " coming-of-age " hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters .  some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form .  unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .  the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology .  often comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick .  however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie .  that honour should definitely go to the " oscar " -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career .  newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release .  yet , even if they are immune to the george lucas' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture .  
1787	one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain .   " so , are we all going to die ? "  the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story's opening line as he evacuates his flooded town .  the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough .  and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so .  populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors .  one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture .  besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie .  graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines .  director mikael salomon's staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening .  the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . 's dark and ugly cinematography .  the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water .  onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie .  christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom .  edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie .  coming to their " rescue " is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman .  he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan .  the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom .  along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix-weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver .  the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest .  they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake .  christopher young's emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear-shattering loudness .  the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town .  the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns .  the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly .  when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees .  counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other .  the show has a single , but unprintable , good line .  betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen-pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter .  the show concludes with a sickening set of twists .  the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad .  hard rain runs 1 : 37 .  it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers .   ( the two families behind us shockingly had a half-dozen preschoolers among them . )  
1788	it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a . i .  artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material .  for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e . t .  to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples .  a . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies .  it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances .  the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children .  and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution .  a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love .  as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor ) .  their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness .  the first third of a . i .  deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin .  circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons .  he is abandoned and alone .  david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him .  the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish .  during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex .  spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal " flesh fair " where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers .  here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots .  the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange .  at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters .  it is all very anti-climatic and jarring .  these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film .  a . i . is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating .  it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images .  but a . i .  is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment .  if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving .  he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please .  after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes .  law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand david's quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey .  probably the toughest role is o'connor's monica .  playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family .  she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action .  many of a . i . 's futuristic sets are breathtaking , especially a mostly submerged new york , lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps .  a . i . is a flawed film , and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera .  would it have been darker ?  more cynical ?  we will never know .  we can only judge what is before us on the screen , a collaboration of two cinematic giants .  a . i .  is a most interesting and thought-provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us .

1793	the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment .   " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point .  once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) .  add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits .  bob's your uncle !  better make that walt's your uncle . . .  kids will no doubt go ga-ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more .  maybe an animated feature without--shock !  horror ! --the  songs , for example ?  or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ?  how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ?  it isn't gonna happen .  like disney's previous entries , " mulan " is slow to make its mark .  the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought .  however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks .  highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( " i'll make a man out of you , " penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself .  voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date .  when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army .  since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace .  attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d .  wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability .  she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time .  
1794	available for rental - october 12 , 1999  10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew .  that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short .  with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance .  yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage .  the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford .  their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly .  in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family " no dating " policy is amended to " bianca can date . . . when  [katarina] does . "  with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew .  don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister " . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . "  getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing .  when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice .  the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit " someone with money . "  in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca .  cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out .  the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison .  moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that " hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . "  the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet .  providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom .  it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait .  yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .

1798	a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars .  what is the point of this ?  i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far .  to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace .  wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time .  the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight .  many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game .  i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie .  it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though .  freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair .  wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie .  this was definitely his worst performance to date .  after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed .   ( for now anyway . )  christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth .  blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there .  his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this .  blair is under the command of " angel " , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd " maniac marshall " , played by matthew lillard .  matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too .  his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie .  the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth .  this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all .  this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on .  the acting is horrible in wing commander .  many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless .  the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it .  the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music .  the special effects are very unrealistic .  when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them .  the explosions look very unrealistic as well .  a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second .  this is very unrealistic .  music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time .  the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding .  after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film .  blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft .  for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space .  it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time .  it's not much fun to watch at all .  if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home .  at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it .  the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !

1813	absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
1814	ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition  synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ?  believe it .  sliding doors is a love 'what if' story .  the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .  in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job .  so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) .  helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future .  the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories .  in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train .  arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  this leads to a life where helen moves out .  helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business .  in story two , helen experiences a different fate .  she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity .  in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry .  will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ?  opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks .  at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .  sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .  not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance .  when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about !  nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .  nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , " i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "  when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache .  and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .  instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk .  another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation .  in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local .  there are minor inconveniences .  since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two .  distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles .  but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing .  also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters .  but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang .  possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ?  sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in .  monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?  
1815	an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
1816	my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory . however , of the 10 pages of reviews , only a handful are negative . i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future . i admit , i 'm more inspired to write reviews when i do n't like a movie than as to when i do , so my handful of reviews are all negative . still , that does n't mean i 'm biased towards not enjoying a movie , but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy . paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i 've seen in years . by using an " intelligent " concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories , the movie ends up the worst of all worlds . it is art for arts sake , but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish . giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment . directors ca n't write , writers ca n't direct . ( i 'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated , but that is because he 's an actor turn director { which rarely works , either } ) . what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that do n't make any sense , are not completed in 5 minutes and in total , spoil paris to me . why call it paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck ? there are only a couple stories that are watchable , most notably the piece by alfonso cuarón , but everything else will fall into obscurity . the coen brothers short is passable , but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar ? it 's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it . as we all love paris , present company included , we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks . in fact , i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes . seriously . seriously . people , natalie portman is not a good actress . she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours . and maggie gyllenhaal , why ? ! ? are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies ? i 'm looking at you natalie portman ( garden state , closer ) , elijah wood ( sin city ) and catalina sandino moreno ( maria full of grace ) . one final comment on the acting : i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again . find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable . writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right . i 'm thinking of ernst hemingway , raymond carver , f. scott fitzgerald , and john cheever , just to name a few . it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this . the same can be said about short films . it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history . if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story , then do n't expect to enjoy this movie at all . the directors either did n't care or were lazy . in either scenario , by the time you are reading this it means you rented it . praise be that you did n't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it .

1822	in december of 1996 , a little movie called " scream , " was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens .  first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both " scream " movies , " i know what you did last summer , " " urban legend , " etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's " can't hardly wait . "  it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : " varsity blues , " " jawbreaker , " " cruel intentions , " " simply irresistible , " " the rage : carrie 2 , " and " the mod squad . "  coming april 9 are two more of this type : " never been kissed " and " go , " and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire " election " and the teen horror-comedy " idle hands . "  jeesh !  out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , " 10 things i hate about you , " is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum " she's all that . "  although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , " 10 things i hate about you , " a modern-day version of shakespeare's " the taming of the shrew " ( " she's all that " got its inspiration from " pygmalion " ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's " the breakfast club . "  and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in " she's all that ? " ) .  the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) .  although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to .  kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey .  as you can see , " 10 things i hate about you " includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) .  at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of " she's all that , " where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , " you're vapor " ) .  since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .  aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot .  aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( " 3rd rock from the sun " ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings .  as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries " the '60s " ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her .  even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality .  no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does .  heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles .  one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set .  in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has .  one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal .  allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl " chill " mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good .  although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters .  in one very funny scene , chastity asks , " i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? "  at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant .   " 10 things i hate about you " once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s .  it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) .  by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) .  luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about " 10 things i hate about you , " but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .

1826	if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny .  by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld .  is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ?   ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . )  1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain .  how will loveless accomplish this ?  well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course .  bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train .   ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . )  racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's " hip " attitude toward the black thing .   ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a " nigger " before that person can finish speaking the word .  super . )  at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy .   ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . )  jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of " the fresh prince of bel-air " demonstrate .  smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero .  in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off .  smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging .  what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ?  this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director .  wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic .   ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops  him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . )  wild wild west's bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant " his master's voice " joke , are all part of the film's first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second .  when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale .  
1827	susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt . i 'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers . i 'm not one of them . i 've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens . the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there . she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn . young mr. rijn contributes the worst performance in the film , in fact one of the worst acting jobs i 've seen in a long time . no wonder he 's not gone anywhere . i will say that seidelman 's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot . but her work with her live performers did n't measure up . i 'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with . look fast and you 'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler . if you like punk rock , you might sit through this for the soundtrack . i 'll stick to bing crosby .

1836	maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there's a world of difference between artists and technicians .  the artist has a vision to create something new .  he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before .  a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox .  obviously successful films need both skills .  brian de palma is a masterful technician .  he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .  he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .  in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .  to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called " 2001 " .  i enjoyed it even more when it was titled " close encounters " .  nasa has set its sights for mars .  when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .  they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .  and it's all so boring .  there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin .  when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from " dune " ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .  error .  the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off .  error .  the alien is laughable .  error .  the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .  error .  there's some nice eyecandy .  the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .  a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .  maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .  but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before .  from " 2001 " , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room .  >from " close encounters " , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .  the list goes on .  the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .  even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .  no one seems to care about anything that happens .  you won't either .  the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .  they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

1845	by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .  action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .  audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out .  somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them .  i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned .  sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .  with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) ,  something this bad can't help but look even worse .  the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .  sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .  science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .  attempts at characterization fall apart .  intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .  special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .  but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .  this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .  i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .  there is some promise , but it's all in the setup .  we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .  when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .  on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .  together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .  for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .  the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .  then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous .  this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things " exciting . "  additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest .  it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .  what about that a-list cast ?  not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue .  dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .  sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .  their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .  then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .  i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) .  if that's the case , forgiveness is granted .  i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) .  even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .  he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .  no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland .  it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .

1849	pieced ( edited ) together from dead body parts ( deleted scenes ) from corpses ( anchorman ) , the frankenstein monster ( wake up , ron burgundy ) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes ( something you 'd ever want to watch twice ..... maybe even once for that matter . ) more often than not -the relativity of the scenes in wurb are made relevant by a third person narrator . even more troubling is that the characters in wurb are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman ( in opening narration we 're told wurb takes place shortly after the original . ) at the end of anchorman , burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co - anchorwoman / lover . in this film , he 's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to veronica ( quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to wurb . )   the part that makes this a movie , a continually evolving story , involves a bank - robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock . these scenes are almost painful to sit through . this part was scrapped from the original scripts for anchorman . the majority of other scenes involving our channel 4 news team are clearly alternate / deleted takes on scenes from anchorman . they go to the same party as in the original , the same original " group bitching about having a woman on the team " scene , and the same cat fashion show segment that veronica had objections to reporting . burgundy re - creates their first date with the drive - in spot overlooking san diego and dinner at his favorite club , tinos . neither character make mention that they 've been to the drive - in spot before and when burgundy walks into tinos with veronica , he introduces it to her as though they 've never been before . oh , and they 're wearing the same clothes as on their original date . still , i have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if wurb is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration . between the two ron burgundy stories - this is the weaker one . looking back on it , it 's quite a feat for anchorman to have risen from the ashes of wurb . you stay classy , imdb . thanks for stopping by .
1850	i feel like i 'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh 's performance . he is a fine actor by most accounts , but he simply could not pull off the southern accent . i mean , it was deplorable . it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank . one of the previous reviewers questioned why u.s. actors were not cast in this film . i second that notion . it 's wonderful when actors / actresses wish to expand their horizons , but it 's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained . maybe it was altman , but he 's a such a great director ... well , i really do n't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much . everybody deserves to screw up here and there . but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you 'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man .

1852	for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
1853	no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its = purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly .  event = horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have = watched this will agree with me .  it is not even original in that sense , = and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even = blade runner .  the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and = methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying .  the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since = enormously progressed .  the event horizon is actually a ship built for a = secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space = thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a = man's lifetime .  the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation = but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune .  a = search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to = check for survivors of the event horizon .  the designer of the ship , dr . = weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually = happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship .  event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , = alien would ever be .  while in alien , the crew has to cope with a = ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , = the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful = and horrifying .  the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup = is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud = `enough !  i can't stand this anymore ! ' .  there are more than enough jolts = to send your adrenalin pumping overtime .  the story in itself is not = exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , = average by most commercial standards .  even so , the essence of horror is = carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced = storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences = ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship = board ) . =20  director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of = `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the = bounds of the term `horror' .  this picture did not do very well in the us = box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most = audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend = their friend to watch this .  although on the face of it , event horizon is = mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense = to keep audiences in focus .  however , the offbeat horror element which it = ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing .  my friend and i could = not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the = `experience' of event horizon .  i guess it was just the immense feeling = of dread which the film had cast upon us .  be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure = entertainment .  be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch = this film !  event horizon is highly recommended=85=85but at your own = risk !  it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , = and event horizon is one .  
1854	in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , " glory , " but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994's " legends of the fall , " and 1996's " courage under fire . "  those two films weren't bad , just not very good , but with zwick's latest film , " the siege , " he has finally made one .   " the siege , " is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city .  investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it .  later , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more .  they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist .  there are some movies that simply don't need to be made , and , " the siege " may very well be one of them .  oh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a " meaningful " action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , " die hard , " which also starred bruce willis .  this time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax .  whatever points , " the siege , " earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place .  the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , " john caprenter's vampires , " by placing them all in the category of " bad guys . "   " the siege , " contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development .  bening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character .  by the climax of , " the siege , " with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called " message " of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , " on deadly ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment .   " the siege " is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay .

1857	there's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book " screenwriting made easy . "  this is funny the first time just 'cause it is , but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it , outlined it and then wrote this film .  it's like they took the sub-genre of the disaster pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them : the stupid , eccentric characters .  yes , " the poseidon adventure " is crap , but it's fun 'cause of all the stupid , eccentric characters .  and " earthquake , " my god !   " earthquake " has got to be one of the worst movies of all time , but at least they had the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold .   " volcano " takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts again later then stops . . . only  it's in , dare i say it ?  l . a ! ! ! ) and then puts no stupid , stereotypical , eccentric characters in it .  they're just stupid .  and the actors are all good ones .  tommy lee jones is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movie of the summer ) .  anne heche is a good indy actress .  don cheadle stole the disappointing " devil in a blue dress " from denzel's feet .  and gaby's one of the few good teenage actors .  but they get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on .  they do their best , god bless them , but they're all lost in the fake magma ( only don cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the film ) .  there's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone .  i actually was rooting for gaby's character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn't have to keep saving her ( he did it like thirty times ! ) .  and there are no interesting sites in l . a . that we see get destroyed .  part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever .  in " independence day , " the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) was watching the white house and empire state building get blown up by the aliens .  that was cool .  watching really fake-looking magma plow down the street is not .  okay , so the film's not devoid of merit .  as i already stated , don cheadle was great and the cast does their best .  and there's this really moronic scene which looks cool .  john carrol lynch ( norm from " fargo " ) goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it .  he has one guy who's wounded and could make it .  he could throw the guy and jump and still survive .  but no ! ! !  he has to go and inanely jump and land right in the middle of the lava .  here's the cool sight : he melts .  here's the dumb part of it : he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting .  cool sight .  no logic .  but cool sight .  the volcano erupts twice and for some reason , the film ends there .  they aren't worried about it eruting again , they just go home to their toppled homes .  but to tell the truth , i was glad they didn't go on .  i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended .  my god , it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film .  i haven't seen " dante's peak " but i've heard it's a masterpiece compared to this .  if you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting , rent " the towering inferno " with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervescent o . j .  simpson ( he saves a cat ) .  if you want to waste your time watching a boring , stupid disaster flick ( literally , it almost grossed half of its budget ) , see this .  but i warned you .

1859	a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like " head over heels , " " boys and girls , " " down to you " and " she's all that . "  while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not .  i first saw him in the independent dark comedy " the house of yes , " where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families .  prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes .   " summer catch " certainly won't help his case .  inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time .  the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star .  ryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team .  it's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates .  the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like " bull durham , " but haven't got a clue how to get there .  and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes .  the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas .  in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from " buffy the vampire slayer , " hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , " he does have a nice ass .  a bubble butt . "  when lillard gives him an " are you insane ? "  look , blucas calmly says , " it's nothing sexual , " then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's .  speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie .  the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots .  blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film .  sick of hearing teammates make " fat chick " jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies .  while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie .  trivial tidbit : " summer catch " marks a scooby doo summit .  marc blucas appears in " jay and silent bob strike back " as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon .

1866	by starring in amy heckerling's " clueless " two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of " the crush " -- out of the water .  her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's " batman & robin , " where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl .  now , she's the star and producer of " excess baggage , " a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level .  silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally .  in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw .  but before the police can " rescue " her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back .  when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there .  along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation .  it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections .  for at least a half-hour , " excess baggage " bounces along fast and efficiently .  during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor .  but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once .  a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and " excess baggage " likely covers its territory .  of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome .   " do you like my tummy ? "  emily coos to vincent at one point in the film .  huh ?  did i miss something ?  the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes .  then again , " excess baggage " becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise .  a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded .  motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative .  scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions .   " excess baggage " has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand .  i loved silverstone's turn in " clueless " as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's " emma . "  looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for " excess baggage . "  sadly , however , " excess baggage " is no " clueless . "  but , on the other hand , it is clueless .  
1867	 " well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it's mission : impossible .  difficult should be a walk in the park for you . "  ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch .  a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection .  a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) .  posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do .  the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods .  ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's .  reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team .  ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah .  although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) .  that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo .  the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while .  unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series .  ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) .  john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups .  the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film .  thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed .  robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus .  after that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films .  the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) .  as far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare .  anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) .  even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .

1889	those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
1890	on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
1891	so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
1892	 . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
1893	it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
1894	as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
1895	the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . 
1896	a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
1897	watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
1898	the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
1899	it arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications . 
1900	my wife and i just finished watching bûsu aka the booth . she fell asleep during some parts of the movie . i really wish i had taken a snooze with her , but the unfortunate fact is that the main character 's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep . when our protagonist speaks , it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke . he also has no redeeming qualities . i was hoping he 'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film . do n't get me wrong , i love asian horror cinema , but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all . if you want some good asian cinema , check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror . avoid the booth like the plague , especially if you suffer from frequent migraines .
1901	is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say , yes , 'it's like having an old friend for dinner' . 
1902	i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood . the acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful . i do n't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do . i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees . it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap . i bet the movie was made in less than a day . i do n't know what category it falls into . please , avoid this movie at all costs , just do anything , even bang your head against walls but do n't go for this movie .
1903	a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
1904	the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
1905	 . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
1906	i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad , there would be broken furniture , traces of smack and cocaine on the floor , and a dead prostitute in the bathroom .  i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad , there might be the same elements present .  coincidence ?  poor kyle ( a meek looking jon favreau ) . . . he is about to marry his radiant fiancee , laura ( cameron diaz ) .  but before he exchanges his vows , he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout .  but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get .  the prostitute has met a horrible , though accidental death , and drugs are everywhere .  the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time .  a surprisingly calm robert boyd ( christian slater ) , who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions , ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where she'll never be found .  although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body ( which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases ) , when they return from their trip , guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends .  one is adam ( daniel stern ) he grows increasingly agitated .  whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way , his blood pressure increases .  or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family .  another is michael , who was actually responsible for her death .  he tries to bury his feelings , but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well .  boyd is the ? doer' of the group .  seemingly suffering from a long psychosis , when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed , he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks .  kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to laura's demanding expectations .  then , there's moore ( leland orser ) who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face .  the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy , but it presents things in a manner that just aren't funny .  drugs , mutilation , and killing your own friends isn't something to be laughed at .  as a straight psychological drama , i could see how it might have worked , as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick ways .  but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours .  if you do like this movie , i don't think that i want to know you .  i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the ? smart play . '  and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding-needing fiancee .  but her talents are essentially wasted here .  it's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone .  but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless .  do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film .  
1907	this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
1908	dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
1909	some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust . 
1910	'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
1911	i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great , so i went out and bought it . what a mistake , the acting is a shambles , the special effects ( if you could call them that ) , look like something that would n't be out of place at a school play . some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen , which unfortunately is all to often . as for a story , forget it . this is a warning , do n't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen . if , for some reason , you like this film watch troll 2 , you will probably enjoy that as well .
1912	this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie i 've ever seen . perfect , beautiful , funny , simply wonderful . i found this movie delightful , even with it 's french taking - itself - too - seriously deep meanings thing going on . i loved it - it 's a great love story . and i loved the way algerians were woven in - and by the way , the music during the final credits is great . i want the cd !
1913	witless but watchable . 
1914	the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
1915	there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
1916	a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
1917	 . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
1918	first of all , in defense of joan fontaine , it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce , the young british lady who has the title role . fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here , but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned . fortunately , she went on to better things . but here it 's fred astaire , george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing -- and they are excellent . fans of burns & allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire 's dance routines . especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar . they join astaire in what has to be the film 's most inventive highlight . unfortunately , not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story -- nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer . it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment . only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs . some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve . the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner , at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant , constance collier and montagu love ( as joan 's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire ) . it 's a lighthearted romp whenever burns & allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days . both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire 's footwork . director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine 's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera - work can not disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire 's dance partner , something she seems painfully aware of .
1919	this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
1920	the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
1921	grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
1922	purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
1923	average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass . it generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another , but never coalesce into a totality . while this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking , it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon . an overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like kar - wai wong and tarantino , but to me it comes across as andy warhol warmed over . the only redeeming characteristic i find is in the production values , and them there just ai n't going to cut it all by themselfs . this is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes . sorry . the calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir . i get the same big yawn and let - down reading what i guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible . ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun . call me a philistine roaming the streets of hong kong looking for a bowl of chop suey .
1924	has all the depth of a wading pool . 
1925	like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
1926	it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
1927	bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as ' the member of the wedding . ' to wit , a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper . while critics love ' member of the wedding , ' i find julie harris to be a jumbo - drag and an adenoidal , scenery - chomping thespian in everything she 's been in . this portrays irritating , rich idiots as in last year at marienbad , but this time it 's a travelogue . in this preminger movie sequences develop , but characters do not . for the first 30 minutes he 's content to blur the father - daughter relationship between seberg and niven , making uncomfortable sexual readings possible . once the conflict is introduced , seberg ca n't deliver the depth the part requires . kerr pulls rank and turns the film into ' endless love . ' seberg 's vacuous narration , is like something out of strange interlude - it is not good . i really wish someone other than niven was in his role . he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies , he never gets around to the character . in the most memorable sequence , an evening out dancing becomes a free - for - all in a harbor . bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise , ' the conformist . ' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain ( as in black narcissus , night of the iguana , king and i , heaven knows mr. allyson , tea and sympathy , etc . etc . ) . really , kerr was a horrible actress . i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash , or even better , start with one . people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this .
1928	mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 
1929	a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
1930	there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been .  the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .  to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews .  jakob , however , never stops moving .  it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset .  he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .  the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior .  after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near .  when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto .  the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes .  a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive .  this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams .  i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year .  compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) .  jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them .  when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .  oh yes , and then there's that little girl .  some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar .  they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships .  jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina .  every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .  it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .  director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) .  there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .  jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste .  and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away .  
1931	every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
1932	vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
1933	to me movies and acting is all about telling a story . the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account . in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best . to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel , made this story all the more compelling . you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman , gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life . susan hayward 's fear , reluctance , but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her . one could also feel david 's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home . as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle . raymond massey 's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger . the sets were real enough , and the atmosphere believable . all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it 's kind . i gave it a rating of ten .
1934	there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
1935	kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
1936	the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
1937	cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
1938	the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
1939	because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
1940	the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
1941	i hated every minute of it . 
1942	a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
1943	yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex .  neve campbell and starship trooper's denise richards getting it on ?  ok !  yeah , it's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that's your main interest in this film , there's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes .  wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however .  nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie .  but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn't leave much time to enjoy the surprises .  we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making .  guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts .  right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " .  the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you'll be soaked from head to toe when you're done .  on the weekend of the car wash , kelly's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day .  naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations .  but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor .  pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray .  yes , that bill murray !  sound like a good , complete movie ?  yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning .  in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film .  it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time .  by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable .  unfortunately , with so much going on , you're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about .  this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could've been .  the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken .  the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing .  and it's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones .  dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film .  in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade .  that's how cheezy it comes off .  but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full's .  in the right hands , wild things could've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting .  and what's up with these people passing as high school students ?  i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker .  i won't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure .  as corny as it is , it's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort .  but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better .  of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you'll be right at home with wild things .  perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .  
1944	showtime is closer to slowtime . 
1945	instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture
1946	the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
1947	sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
1948	appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
1949	more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
1950	like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
1951	the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
1952	 . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
1953	in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
1954	this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
1955	viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture . 
1956	the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
1957	beautifully crafted and brutally honest , promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the middle east struggle and into the humanity of its people . 
1958	this is one of the worst films ever . i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . where are the images in the film that are on the box ? i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .   why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading ? i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . i have no one to blame except myself . i want my money and time back .   do not watch this movie .   even if curiosity is motivating you , stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . it will be much more enjoyable . you have been warned !
1959	this was on at 2 or so in the morning one saturday a few years ago , for various reasons i do n't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters . dom has had a unfortunate lot , manipulated & literally working a rubbish job , eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling . tom hulce ' dom does n't plead for sympathy - it comes naturally . ray liotta is a universe away from henry hill , displaying a soft centre in what must feel a thankless position . in many ways this deals with the dilemma many young carer 's face - the past or the future . as it turns out , with some work the two can happily co - exist . thoughtfully handled & sensitively played dominick & eugene is difficult not to warm to .
1960	this is a really heart - warming family movie . it has absolutely brilliant animal training and " acting " ( if you can call it like that ) as well ( just think about the dog in " how the grinch stole christmas " ... it was plain bad training ) . the paulie story is extremely well done , well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too . not more to say except that this is a great movie ! my ratings : story 8.5/10 , acting 7.5/10 , animals+fx 8.5/10 , cinematography 8/10 . my overall rating : 8/10 - big family movie and very worth watching !
1961	a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
1962	can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ?  i think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe .  the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date .  unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary .  the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday .  what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder .  that's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy .  and this is supposed to make sense .  really .  from the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film .  the film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac's return excruciatingly boring .  plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin's unbelievably horrible script , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion .  everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac's return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash .  the bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible .  another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat .  and what's with that title ?  the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film .  let's pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series .  one of the worst horror films in years .  
1963	ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
1964	compellingly watchable . 
1965	with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
1966	if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
1967	doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
1968	this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
1969	sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
1970	an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
1971	renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
1972	the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .   " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however , as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .  
1973	in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere .  but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii .  in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality .  very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert .  whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible .  the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond .  the movie is set in 2018 .  for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child .  jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border .  sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed .  although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence .  jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape .  such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen .  after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity .  the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable .  by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too .  of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society .  the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors .  lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia .  kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance .  lambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion .  
1974	sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
1975	the movie " atlantis : the lost empire " is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently . parents who have had to sit through " the jungle book 2 " or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one . the film is one of few to attempt at an original story ; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories . films such as " toy story " , " finding nemo " , and " monsters inc. " all do the same , but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney . recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video , and are sequels to an existing successful film . the quality of those films is given way to the profitability . a new era started with " atlantis " following it were " mulan " , " lilo & stitch " , and most recently " open range " . the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past . a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis , a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years . including that of young milo thatch , voiced by michael j. fox . milo is employed by a museum in washington d.c .. his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist , who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis . this was seen as a waste by his peers , and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps . after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition , milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment . she takes him to her employer , a mr. whitmore . whitmore was a close friend of milo 's grandfather , and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis . mr. whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything . the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers . the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch . the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis . the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis , not just the discovery of people . it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience . the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation . the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images . a feat not easily achieved , most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two . the characters are believably human . there are some nice chase type scenes , with lots of action going on . a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get . the creativity of the writers really shines through . the culture of atlantis is richly developed , including an entire language . the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources , such as plato . the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained . believable , if by a younger audience , that magic really does exist . the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic , but can best be described in this way . although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic . the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo 's nautilus , complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes . the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology . the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been , even holding roles in leadership . this is not a bad thing . it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to , rather than an all male cast . one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song , ever . a tradition that began with the first feature film , " snow white " , and carried on through to " the lion king " , almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs . this is great and all , what would the seven dwarfs be without " hi ho ! " ? after the millionth time through it 'd almost be better without , but this one spares the parent . not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song . i for one am grateful . the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike . it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children .

1980	bill condon's " gods and monsters " is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics " frankenstein " and " bride of frankenstein . "  since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations .  whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him .  as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home .  james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , " a dirty old man . "  in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing .  because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off .  clayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past .  certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis .   " gods and monsters " is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a " motion picture director , " rather than a " horror director . "  and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore .  it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life .  as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself .  he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person .  through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life .  although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him .  since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor .  although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness .  it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the " on-again-off-again " friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable .  we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds .  in lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this .  also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again .  if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether .   " gods and monsters " is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone .  the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end .  walking away from " gods and monsters , " it was ian mckellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably .  it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else's business in the first place .  
1981	maguire is a surprisingly effective peter/spider-man . 
1982	if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
1983	perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the ' arthouse / festival crap ' trashcan . it 's not the greatest film of 2005 , nor is it complete garbage . it just has a lot of problems . i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ' ideological fears ' , or ' conservative taboos ' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called ' courageous ' and ' uncompromising ' abroad . it was banned because the censors knew 99 % of the russian film - goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film . so we have a strong opening shot . wonderful sound design , excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism . the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film 's strongest aspects ( not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge ) . over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup . an amusing and well - written bar conversation among the 3 ( main ? ) characters , and we feel pathos for these people , the great country of russia , the human condition and all that . then the movie starts slowing down . we begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead . the rest is quite boring , simply put . sure , the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings , and there are some slightly amusing moments . nice sound , sure . but the enjoyment of this movie , not to mention the plot , are seriously compromised by the pacing problems . and this , this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the ( nicely - shot ) abject misery and bleakness , is what ultimately will make people angry at the ' offensive ' stuff ( personally , the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing , in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear ) . if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time ( the entire film ) , watch particulars of the national hunt . much more rewarding post - soviet stuff . so yeah , a 4 out of 10 for 4 , nice and symbolic of my post - mediocre - film condition .

1991	movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ?  the script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ?  there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ?  six days , seven nights is simply a waste .  let's see .   .   .  we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ?  so , how do we do that ? ?  well , we'll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we'll make him a crusty old pilot . ?  but wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer . ?  but wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ?  i know ! ?  they'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ?  yessssss ! ?  so , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ?  shucks .  oh , i've got it ! ?  we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ?  then , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ?  then , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ?  oh , yes ! ?  i feel so good about this story . ?  instead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ?  imagine that .  don't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ?  the sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent .   ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ?  schwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ?  and reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ?  even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences .  it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ?  the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ?  the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , " why did you pick this awful script ! ? " ?  the film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ?  for instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ?  this is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ?  in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story .  this is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ?  1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ?  when i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for " two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . "   ? why didn't she know the name of the film ? ?  i suppose she just didn't care .   ? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ?  good actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents .  
1992	more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .

1995	who was george c. scott ? george c. scott was a renowned actor . practically any movie that he 's been in is the better off for it . now ol' george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... , but he once said something that describes said movie to a t. i do n't recall his exact words , but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting , but great acting cannot save bad writing . never has this little observation been truer than in " the all new adventures of laurel & hardy : for love or mummy " . the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect . bronson pinchot ( laurel ) and gailard sartain ( hardy ) not only look the parts , but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal ( mannerisms and all ) . this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents . that said , this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to ( you guessed it ) writing . aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain ( which was very " in character " ) and a brief gag involving a taxi , this movie is an absolute chore to sit through . problem # 1 : too much time and effort went into the plot . i do n't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady . what i want is to see stan and ollie ( or at least , their stand - ins ) . way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not - very - funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around . however , even if this movie had been all jokes , that would still leave us with ... ... problem # 2 : most of the jokes are what i would call " watered - down " slapstick .   what do i mean by " watered down " ? in slapstick , a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ( ala looney tunes , 3 stooges ... ,or how about laurel & hardy ? ) . in " watered - down " slapstick ( as i define it ) , a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced , and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect . maybe an illustration would help : in looney tunes , daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd . his bill falls off and he puts it back on . that is classic slapstick . in this " gem " , ollie accidentally bumps into some people . they turn around , tell him to be careful , and continue on their merry way . that 's not slapstick . that 's not even funny . that 's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes . it 's as though they 're this movie 's bread and butter . the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they 're supposed to be funny . granted , the example i just gave is the most extreme case , but i can only cut it so much slack . long story short : the film just does n't work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot 's and sartain 's abilities to impersonate stan and ollie . instead , the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes . watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with . not a good movie , but an incredible sleeping aid . i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal ( just so long as you steer clear of " atoll k " and " be big " ) .

2000	admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
2001	the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered .  with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols .  their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness .  less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue .  not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development .  that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level .  the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis .  intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of " human interconnectedness " and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) .  shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene .  those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself .  adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london .  every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives .  he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years .  she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction .  they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation .  as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines .  in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy .  if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment .  chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train .  the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines .  these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes .  separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center .  despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image .  intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw .  an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) .  as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk .  bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with .  his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations .  in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best .  he's that good .

2006	i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer .  it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the " best movie " honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon .  it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it .  from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt .  in spawn , it was the " living room hell " conclusion at the end .  in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces .  and all of face/off was pretty dang good .  but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches .  i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted .  and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review .  back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? )  i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots .  okay , that one was pretty pathetic . )  few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find .  this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black .  kind of weird , huh ? )  all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell .  i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . .  sorry .  my apologies to o'donnell fans .  i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely .  he decided not to sell them to me , because they were " innappropriate " .  hmm . . . .  so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years .  good question .  i'll move on to the movie now .  as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . )  men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth .  not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe .  not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that .  i'm not even really paying attention anymore . )  the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black .  i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the " cool weapons " they had .  the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said .  and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have .  it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for " black humor " , directing both addams family movies .  this movie was basically a " black comedy " , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers .  don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie .  it's not bad , i gave it * * * .  it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it .  my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket .  of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point .  i think .  
2007	a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
2008	the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
2009	we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .

2020	all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
2021	whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
2022	when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
2023	allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
2024	münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
2025	this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play " hospitality suite . ''its  about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation .  he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention .   " the big kahuna " revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department .  these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite .  the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life .  the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why .  what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living .  these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch .  their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical .  following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high .  in this case , it is landing the big kahuna .  they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him .  what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product .  and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each .  the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen .  larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life .  bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ .  his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in .  bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion .  to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible .  when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him .  the contrast in their personalities is stark .  larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale .  he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman .  he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out .  he tells him to go on a vacation .  get a woman .  while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long .  he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in .  he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale .  larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale .  in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him .  this is his first time for him on the road .  when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering .  when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account .  but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus .  bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend .  larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch .  but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller's attention about their company's product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room .  these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass .  the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives .  these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance .  the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience .  but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .  
2026	the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
2027	she may have an oscar and a golden globe , but this film shows why she also is a perennial razzie nominee . to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money . she could do ads on why you should n't talk on a cell phone while driving , especially at night on the way to a crowded mall . susan montford should stick to producing ( shoot ' em up ) as she is not very good as a writer / director . she is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot , and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun . what does she do ? she starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something . she manages to get away , but gets lost in the forest after crashing . why did n't she run to someones house ? we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox . of course , their guns are no match for her wrench . ha ! of course , she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver . those poor thugs . now , she 's home for christmas - and she brought a gun !
2028	anemic , pretentious .

2032	both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
2033	after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house .  the review  two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense .  each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising .  if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two .  writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit .  the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party .  while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head .  things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses .  where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you .  david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom's house or just down the street .  by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) .  unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity .  humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting .  several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes .  also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away .  kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably .  his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie .  kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most " wife who can no longer handle her husband " parts .  while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls " a private club that i'm not invited to " , where they whisper about things all day long .  as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time .  both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are .  fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes .  it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film .  if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year's best .  
2034	everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .

2037	a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
2038	by phil curtolo " madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . "  now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some .  the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to .  so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see .  simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane .  the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that's trapped inside by all the notes and chords .  she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon-to-be first president of argentina .  they fall in love and eventually marry .  sounds pretty good , doesn't it .  well the story gets better , as eva goes on the " rainbow tour " across europe , trying to win respect .  eva duarte was a wonderful lady .  however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood .  i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right .  they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar .  although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance .  as the " spiritual leader of argentina , " madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line .  but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film .  don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade .  i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen .  if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie .  now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in .  all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie .  now you may be saying , " what kind of critic is he ? , "  and you're right .  as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance .  but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan , it was way too hard .   ,

2045	at least it 's not full of sensless violence or fluff . it 's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline . this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green . the story is disjointed and goes off in strange directions , to no conclusion . i also do n't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club , either . some of the depictions are absurd . not very engaging .

2052	fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade .  tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity .  most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus .  those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends .  unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal .  sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process .  on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself .  one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 .  in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence .  that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) .  unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality .  death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .  before the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) .  kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime .  bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .  although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .  the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade .  on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .  unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang .  the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .  in short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia .   ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) .

2057	 " marie couldn't talk , " paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family .   " dad couldn't listen .  and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me . "  paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms .  as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up .  benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role .  roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems .  when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out .  if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium .  so it is with paulie .  when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars .  too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again .  tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study .  although misha gets a few nice lines ( " i'm russian .  i like long stories . " ) ,  his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy .  besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg .  naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart .  the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half .  the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills .  when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring .  tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball .  their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation .  it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals .  when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes .   " i'm a bird , " he explains with his frequently subtle humor .   " i have a small brain , and it's about to explode . "  the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music .  with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes .  and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing .   " it's a long story , " says paulie .   " it's the only kind he knows , " reflects misha .  and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long .  the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between .  paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless .  paulie runs 1 : 32 .  it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages .  my son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn't enough action .  he thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good .  his friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was " awesome , excellent , " and gave it * * * * .  he thought paulie was good , but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted .

2059	what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
2060	it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
2061	it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because " titan a . e . " is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it .  i don't know what this film is supposed to be about .  from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race .  that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there's no payoff .  the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil " dredge " aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason .  so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at .  there's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take .  the galaxy here is a total rip-off of the " star wars " universe the creators don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring .  despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it's just not an interesting movie .  
2062	so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton , but they just don't get the good grades .  so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools .  legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide , the remaining roommates will get an automatic 4 . 0 .  chris ( michael vartan ) and tim ( matthew lillard ) are two guys who really want the 4 . 0 to get into harvard .  how far will they go to get their 4 . 0 ?  chris and tim are also roommates with rand , played by randall batinkoff .  the two scheme to murder rand , make it look like a suicide , so they can supposedly get their 4 . 0 .  they have heard this rumor many places , and they are willing to take the chance to find out .  rand is a very , very mean person .  he treats his girlfriend natalie , played by tamara craig thomas , like she doesn't matter at all .  she is very afraid of him , and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant .  she does tell him , and he becomes enraged .  that night would be the last night of rand's life .  tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison , making him think that it is beer .  rand drinks down the poison , and then dies .  now , tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself .  it does not take long until the suicide note is found , but the body isn't found .  the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information .  feeling extreme guilt , chris is having a very hard time , especially with his girlfriend , emma , played by keri russell .  she wants to know more , but he will not even speak with her .  will he give in ?  will tim turn chris in ?  will chris turn tim in ?  will they turn themselves in ?  all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film .  the events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun .  the plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film .  this film is a very serious one , with not many laughs .  there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films .  the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying .  it is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen .  hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride .  the sound really stood out in the film .  it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film .  the way the movie is filmed is also great .  all of the technical aspects , as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done .  the performances in the curve are very good .  matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role , just like in 1996's scream .   ( a+ ) he is very strange in this film as well .  i like him in this sort of role , rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she's all that .  michael vartan is fantastic as chris , who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 . 0 .  michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed , where he co-starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student .  keri russell also gives a great performance .  she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film .  tamara craig thomas is also realistic , especially coping with the death of her boyfriend .  some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles , such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case .  the bottom line- i might just have to curve that a- into an a .   * note- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 .  it was decided the film would not be released widely .  it is now available at blockbuster video only , and for rent only .  see you at the video store !

2069	a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .  
2070	culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 
2071	having read diamond 's book , i was slightly disappointed in the series , but all in all , it is quite informative . reading the other comments , it is comforting to know that the ' culture warriors ' are hard at work , seeing ' attacks ' on ' western civilization ' under every rug . is diamond a little preachy ? sure . like a lot of academics , he sees his theory as the most important thing ever . he uses the phrase ' guns , germs , and steel ' at seemingly every opportunity during the series . we get it , after about the first 10 minutes . is diamond a little simplistic ( in the series ) ? sure . the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing , condensing some very long , complicated history down to ' smallpox , swords , and horses ' , wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes . but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute ( but not totally define ) the reasons for the spaniard 's success against the established cultures . is he preaching * against * western civilization in any way ? nope . not a word . not to my ear . all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly , * not * that luck is the only reason . in the end , if you 're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority , then this series is not for you . but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail , this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence .
2072	there's a moment in schindler's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground .  one girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes .  it is probably the finest moment through out the film .  when i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not say why .  this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole .  when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red .  at another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied .  like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul .  but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing .  starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings .  the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade .  steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e . t .  -- but it wasn't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be .  the product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you .  throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads .  we watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment .  the film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment and you'll be bitterly dissapointed .  it does reward the patient viewer .  this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece .  this eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem .  it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies .  it leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about .  afterwards you can reflect on individual images , visions , and people .  laconic , removed , schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all , does much , and leaves feeling as if he could , should , have done more then he did and was able to .  the change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker , it would be crude and would cheat the audience .  instead we are told a tale , told a story .  the film is punishing to watch , yes .  but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie .

2075	the heist of a flawless , 84 carat diamond , fixed bare knuckle fights , irish gypsies and a dog are just some of the goings on in director guy ritchies's sophomore feature , " snatch . "   " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " intro'd helmer/scripter ritchie with a hyper-kinetic , in your face underworld comedy that grabbed the viewer's attention from beginning to end .  his protagonists were innocents set adrift in a see of sharks to swim or be eaten alive .  with " snatch , " the director doesn't remake his first work , but he does delve more deeply into the criminal underbelly of london , mining a rich collection of characters in the process .  >from the very beginning , " snatch " tosses you into the action with the theft of the fabulous diamond , the desire of new york gangster avi ( dennis farina ) .  en route from antwerp , diamond thief and courier frankie four fingers ( benicio del toro ) stops in london to make a separate deal with avi's partner and cousin , doug " the head " ( mike reid ) .  frankie's addiction to gambling tempts him into making a bet on an illegal boxing match for boris " the blade " ( rade sherbedgia ) , a ruthless russian mobster .  the bet turns out to be a setup for a robbery by a trio of bumbling incompetents - vinnie ( robbie gee ) , sol ( lennie james ) and portly tyrone ( ade ) - that goes miserably awry .  meanwhile , a couple of young toughs , turkish ( jason stratham ) and tommy ( stephen graham ) , are trying to break in to the boxing game with the help of local villain brick top ( alan ford ) , who also owns a pig farm .  when their first fighter is put out of action , with one punch , by a wild irish gypsy named mickey o'neil , they figure to put the loose canon in as the contender in a fixed fight .  mickey proves less than reliable and goes against turkish and tommy's deal .  brick top , impressed by mickey's performance , decides to gives them another chance - after calmly explaining that it takes 16 pigs about eight minutes to completely devour a corpse .  when avi doesn't get his precious rock , he jumps on a plane for london and hires a local legend , " bullet tooth " tony ( vinnie jones ) , to find frankie and the diamond .  things spiral out of control as all these forces head on a collision course of double-cross and double-deals - and a dog that ate a squeaky toy .  guy ritchie ( mr . madonna to some ) is an extraordinarily talented auteur who has a wonderful knack for pulling together his unique collection of cast and crew and feeding them funny and gritty dialog that spews out of the characters' mouths like machine gun fire .  the helmer marshals his large ensemble actors in a frantically paced caper comedy that makes you laugh and feel queasy at the same time , the above description by brick top being just one example .  the assemblage of actors and non-actors in rough-and-tumble settings gives " snatch " an earthy feel in its depiction of london's criminal underworld .  the cast of characters is too large to credit here , but two of the performances - first among equals , you might say - are worth noting .  alan ford is brilliant as the ruthless , evil brick top .  when he refuses sugar in his tea because " i'm sweet enough , " it makes you shiver , even as you laugh .  his is one of the best gangster characters i've seen in years .  the other outstanding perf is given by none other than brad pitt , the name actor the movie's popularity may hang upon , at least initially .  pitt , as mickey o'neil , is hard drinking , hard fighting , highly unreliable and nearly incomprehensible with a unique irish brogue and dialect of the pikers , the irish travelers of europe .  this gypsy brigand would steal the fillings from your teeth , especially if it would benefit his beloved mum ( sorcha cusack ) .  when brick top threaten the safety of mickey's family , he makes an enemy that cannot be stopped .  pitt puts a credible spin on his character and does some incredible physical stuff , too , as a bare-knuckle boxer .  the production team behind the camera includes ritchie alumni , producer matthew vaughn and lenser tim maurice-jones , and other talented technical artist that bring the hyperactive imagination of the author to visual life .  there is a patent feel to the look of " snatch " and " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " that reeks of " signature " for ritchie , but i'm not sure how this will translate in his future works .  there is so much talent in the filmmaker that i would like to see him branch out in other directions .  nonetheless , " snatch " is terrific sophomore effort , a darn good action comedy and a hoot to boot .  i give it a b+ .  
2076	even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
2077	not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .

2079	one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle . tom hulce was amazing , with out words could convey his feelings / thoughts . i actually sent mike ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed . it is good . system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff . i was in the audience in seattle with hulce and director , a writer i think and mike ferrell . they talked for about an hour afterwords . not really a dry eye in the house . why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know . ( actually i do know , it is our fault , look what we watch)well you get what you pay for guys . get this and see it with someone special . it is a gem .
2080	a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it .

2082	as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
2083	is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
2084	given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
2085	there are a number of problems with this movie , but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little . the base story is quite good , but the money just was n't there to do the story justice . the non - existent budget really killed this movie . stuart gordon ( the writer / director ) has writing credit on ' honey , i shrunk the kids ' , which was a box office smash . however , that movie had some serious cash backing from disney . honestly , this is a good example of when to not make a movie . had he waited a few more years , technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects . ( not to mention he could have found a company with money . )
2086	wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
2087	it's a curious thing - i've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he's much better and so is the movie .  even though , in the sixth sense he is the " name " , he doesn't have the pivotal role .  that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts .  if osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance .  we get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i've seen this year .  the whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter .  one thing about this movie , its target .  this isn't a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup .  one caveat : there's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen .  i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases .  if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , don't let them .  let the director explain on his own pace and you'll enjoy the movie vastly more .  
2088	brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
2089	this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
2090	an awkward and indigestible movie . 
2091	in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife .  in the second , he was avenging his daughter .  in the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend .  fourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz .  however , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for .  this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways .  kersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers .  even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter .  white's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them .  the plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) .  fourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade .  however , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting .  however , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring .  there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end .  the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years .  there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics .   ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .  
2092	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
2093	the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
2094	despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
2095	the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
2096	though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
2097	by-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters , situations , dilemmas and developments that we've seen before in a parade of other films .  a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one .  a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience .  in short , a clich ? -ridden formula film .  welcome to my review of the general's daughter .  plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter's rape , torture and murder .  they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder .  critique : by the numbers ( see above ) .  this film is just there .  it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again .  it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away .  it's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree .  it's as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament .  get the picture ?  i sure did . . . it's  too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed .  easy as pie .  it's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . )  woods chews it up in the few scenes that he's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) .  and this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen .  it's like riding a bike .  other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually " breaking down " to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the " best poor man's michael bay doing his best poor man's impression of tony scott " ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity , and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you're a great director .  yawn .  yeah , whatever tony . . . i  mean , simon . )  and aren't we all sick of hearing about these army " bad boys " and their overdone " code of silence " ? !  enough already !  next subject , please .  see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead .  you'll feel much better afterwards .  trust me .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere .  ironically on james woods' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv's " welcome back , kotter " , starring none other than john travolta .  actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his " big dick " on howard stern's radio program .  unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 .  he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section .  what a man !  john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) .  word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis' home .  director simon west's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) .  before that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants .  yippee !  veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) ,  the manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film .  the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 , 1968 , it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day .  clarence williams iii , who plays colonel fowler in this film , is known to some from his role as " linc " in the original " mod squad " tv series .  younger folk may remember him as prince's father in purple rain .  
2098	with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
2099	it's not a bad thing to update old stories .  it's done all the time in the oral tradition .  the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it's that it's dry .  the new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come .  she's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france .  when her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) .  she works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night .  although the story is updated , you know the plot .  danielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after .  the movie is often like watching a filmed play .  theater in real life is engrossing .  theater on the screen is usually lifeless .  there doesn't seem to be much going on .  the camera can be a star of films .  here it's a co-conspirator .  danielle's convictions are compromised .  a socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man .  a kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge .  the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish .  the fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle .  huston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness .  in all fairness , my companion loved the film .  maybe it's one of those " chick flicks " that men don't like .  it is certainly a date film .  nearly the entire audience was couples .  oh well , maybe it's good for something .  
2100	i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
2101	i just loved every minute of this film .

2103	report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) . 
2104	sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest .  some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " .  some people simply call it " trash " .  a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .  definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .  whew !  anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .  it's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works .  a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting .  well sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare .  whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me .  but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me .  he was great !  cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .  the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him .  misguided ?  you bet .  loveable ?  you bet .  a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah .  this was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .  maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy .  a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming !  not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .

2119	susan granger's review of " two can play that game " ( screen gems )  since the success of " waiting to exhale , " there have been several romantic comedies about african-american professionals .  this female revenge fantasy , vivica a . fox plays shante smith , a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success : a mansion , a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky , hot-shot lawyer , morris chestnut .  she's at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl-friends ( mo'nique , wendy racquel robinson , tamala jones ) .   " when your man messes up , no matter how small it is , " she smugly decrees , " yuh gots to punish him . "  so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival , gabrielle union , she devises her own version of " the rules , " a 10-day " tough love " emotionally punishing plan to get him back .  unfortunately , writer/director mark brown ( " how to be a player " ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who doesn't realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love .  having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the " day one , " " day two " title-card device underscores the tedium .  comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut's boisterous best-friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who's given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson .  but the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " two can play that game " is smarmy if slick 4 , filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca-cola , miller genuine draft ) but little else .  in this r-rated ( for explicit sexual language ) , pseudo-hip battle of the sexes , the audience loses .  
2120	the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
2121	the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . 
2122	ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars  synopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church .  he replies something like : " the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire .  well , the fire wasn't that bad , since , while the church was burning , looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows . "  in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding .  everyone has had to evacuate because it's raining , and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break .  enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) .  suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters .  tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money , hide it , and swim for his life .  this makes for an action movie full of jet skis , speedboat chases , and gun battles , as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call .  he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen ( minnie driver ) .  but unknown to tom and karen , the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call .  will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ?  opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics .  there's not much more to this movie than hiding , running , swimming , shooting , and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning , but that's what makes it escapist and fun .  relax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn .

2131	stephen , please post if appropriate .   " mafia ! " - crime isn't a funny business by homer yen ( c ) 1998  on a particular night when i found myself having some free time , i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see " mafia ! " , a spoof of mafia and crime films such as " the godfather , " " goodfellas " and " casino " .  at 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep .  but by my account , i think that my laff-o-meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle .  i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film .   " mafia ! "  chronicles vincenzo cortino's ( lloyd bridges ) life .  separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life .  but as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord .  following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) .  like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women .   " mafia ! " is co-written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut-busting funny spoofs such as " airplane " and " the naked gun . "  but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .  as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .  crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .  it's a tough genre to parody .  i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say " please " as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .  there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law .  a gunman shoots him several times .  the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .  i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .  oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .  
2132	it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case .

2134	the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
2135	running time approximately 1hr 40mins  reviewed by jack choo  rating :  the movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come .  the story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red .  existenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game .  supposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality .   * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz .  players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience .  during a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) .   * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt .  as they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected .  existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him .  even so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners .  not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly .  existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up .  while in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot .  in existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else .  jennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film .  the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category .  it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! )  which is actually quite good .  existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times .  10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg .  cronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you .  
2136	wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds , emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways . emma ( gwyneth paltrow ) is a graceful , intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess -- and confidant -- to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking . eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her , she decides to match the vicar , mr. elton ( alan cummings ) with her pretty young friend , harriet ( toni collette ) . the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out , with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought . the film is full of jane austen 's witty and wry characterizations . gwyneth paltrow is at her best , portraying this maiden of a restrained , polite society with wit and ease . her growing romance with the unparalleled mr. knightley ( jeremy northam ) is the heart of this film . mr. knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films . he is incredibly handsome , in a modest , relaxed way that is irresistible . he is certainly well - matched to gwyneth paltrow . their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant , has blossomed as he , a family friend , matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more . with a wry look or understated jab at emma , northam 's knightley is a delight to watch . other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson , greta scacchi , ewan mcgregor , polly walker , and the talkative spinster , miss bates , who is very funny . seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations , emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment .
2137	a great story , based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road . being that this is denzel washington 's first ever movie that he himself was gon na direct , i have to admit i was a tad sceptical , but who would n't be .. ? but then again , he 's a great actor with plently of years of experience , and the end result turned out great . the story is told in a great way , making you that has had difficulties during your childhood , and young adulthood , see yourself in those situations . so , it hits you hard , letting you know your not the only one going through hell . in all , a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f***ed up world . ( the story is based on the life of antwone fisher , born 3 . august 1959 , cleveland , ohio , usa , whom was also the writer of this movie ) strongly recommended . 8/10
2138	the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named ' gabe ' , who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole . gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids . the kids in this film are little punks , but they are much less antisocial than they 'd been in other previous films and down deep , they are well - meaning punks . however , in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat -- after all , he 'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed . so , when gabe is about ready to be sent back to " the big house " , it 's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks . the " dead end kids " appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good ( particularly angels with dirty faces ) . however , after the boys ' contracts expired , they went on to monogram studios and the films , to put it charitably , were very weak and formulaic -- with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed " the bowery boys " . because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera , it 's a pretty good film -- and almost earns a score of 7 ( it 's real close ) . in fact , while this is n't a great film aesthetically , it 's sure a lot of fun to watch , so i will give it a 7 ! sure , it was a tad hokey - particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights -- but it was also quite entertaining . the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support . sure , this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming -- so if you can suspend disbelief , it works well .
2139	if he doesn=92t watch out , mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max .  of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too .  although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero .  in ron howard=92s latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers .  mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation .  a veteran of numerous hard-nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently .  the casting is what puts this film over the top .  the trio of gibson , the kidnappers' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully .  sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark .  his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h . g . wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of=  society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting .  gibson=92s character is an all-american hero with a few flaws .  his cowboy=  tactics tend to work , but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with .  in a round about way , if he weren=92t known as a man who i= s willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son wouldn=92t have been kidnapped .  as sinise says " you=92re a payer .  you did it once and now you=92re going to do it again . "  one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities .  lindo calls home to talk to his kids , obviously shaken at working this case .  even the kidnappers are real people , arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars .  gibson=92s break-down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective .  it=92s one of the best filmed representations of a man=92s world falling apart that i=92ve seen .  it=92s not all perfect .  the shoot 'em upending , while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution .  as well crafted as the scene is , we=92ve seen it before .  mullen=92s wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments , but occasionally just seems to be there .  while adequate , brawley nolte ( sean ) doesn=92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around .  but you=92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one .  forget about the large coke , you won=92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later .  
2140	this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey . one sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that " history repeats itself " . life is what it is shown in the movie : when people are young , they seem not to understand their parents , their own spouses ; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late ; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners ; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives ; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved ; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world , and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves , so that when life has to end some day , people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life . the actors and actresses are fantastic . they have understood the director 's intention perfectly . the movie 's charm lies in , to me , the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience .
2141	 . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
2142	>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .  
2143	it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
2144	it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .

2147	not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
2148	here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter .  these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen .  that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags .  observe the opening sequence .  a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) .  they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles .  however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut .  he is undecided .  this happens for about 10 seconds .  the audience finds some humor in his foolishness .  the lights suddenly go out .  cisco is surprised and says : " whoa . . . let's  go ! "  and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence .  the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film .  needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi .  however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss .  infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping .  during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution .  melvin must now find a way to stay alive .  by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ?  cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing .  but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster .  to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster .  but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster .  and so on . . .  there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live .  and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about .  how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ?  what goes on among this clique ?  why is cisco at odds with melvin ?  there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery .  and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on .  if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now .

2150	a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
2151	the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
2152	a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels .  first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie .  but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery .  no no . . .  just kidding .  had you going there for a moment , didn't i ?  in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games .  the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) .  the mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth .  unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance .  the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game .  i'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie .  the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve .  there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot .  and , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office .  mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie .  shao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament .  thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid .  one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought " hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "  too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie .  i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points :   * the acting is truly bad .  sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) .   * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder .  in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics .  i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim " tiny " lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite " utility " actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness .   * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again .   * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) .  for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . .   . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie .  in that case , the following critiques also apply :   * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter .  wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer .  hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene .   * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) .  sonya does her " kiss of death , " jax does his " earthquake , " liu kang does his " animality , " and so on .  a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely .   * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between .  silly , silly folks .  and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match .  lame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it .   * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their " animalities . "  motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie .  for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 .  you'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .  
2153	james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok .  for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race .  human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed .  however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor .  to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born .  in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn .  images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film .  even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines .  in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star .  in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy .  cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it .  unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse .  we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la .  children watch the flames in a burning television .  when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him .  even though the " future is not set , " there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence .  all sara can do is await it .   ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 )  the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too .  after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place .  back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) .  these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans .  true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected .  cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la .  from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done .  arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate .  we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him .  cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot .  while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions .  cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace .  either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs .  the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective .  for a low budget film , the terminator's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done .  special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton .  it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen .  one thing that doesn't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton's hairdo .

2163	let 's eliminate any discussion about the use of non - asian actors playing asian roles . the movie is 67 years old . in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role . actors were under contracts , and did not always have a choice about what role they played . end of story . this is a truly great epic story of love , individual rights , class strata , and men / women issues . the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni .   muni plays wang , a chinese farmer , who is about to take a wife ( rainer ) . from the start , he treats her with respect , during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help . without giving too much of the movie away , they go through the highs and lows of all relationships , and even though the story may take place in late 19th / early 20th century , the story and much of their feelings , seems credible . other than the fact that the movie is about 5 - 10 minutes longer than it needs to be , and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930 's cartoon characters , this is a really wonderful movie that , unfortunately , has become a victim of political correctness . 9 out of 10
2164	the tagline for this film is : " some houses are just born bad " .  so i didn't expect too much from this .  but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .  i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .  i thought , mabe it will be fun ?  and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .  but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .  these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .  here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .  among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .  actually , the doctor is researching the " primordial fear reaction " and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch !  what happens .  but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .  it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .  portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .  a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .  filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .  but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .  the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .  is that exciting or what ?  the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad .  it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson .  a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .  it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .   " the blair witch project " , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .  and with a $70 mill .  budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .  de !  bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .  he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .  but why give him a more serious material ?  in the end " haunting " will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director .  yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad .  the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .  but this is where the good things end .  the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .  it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage .  at first you do not know what's going on .  is this part of the experiment ?  are these hallucinations ?  projections of the subconscience ?  paranoia ?  but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .  the house is actually possessed .  it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .  for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ?  i believe hichock once said that " it's !  better to wait for a climax , than to see one " .  this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .  they are impossible to take seriously .  any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's " the shining " , are absolutely baseless .   " shining " had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .   " haunting " has only special effects and art direction to boast of .  and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .  casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .  but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : " some films are just born stupid " .

2166	a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing . 
2167	it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )  harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .   " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather , why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "  i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .  one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before " action " was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

2175	these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows .  most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past .  but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing .  so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about " modern stone age " family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake .  after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good .  the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age " town " of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america .  fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby .  to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management .  but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme .  in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred .  on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life .  computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show .  unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell .  but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot .  some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film .  result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as " high concept " .  after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version .  all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it .

2186	this is a short , crudely animated series by david lynch ( as it says in the beginning ) , and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods , overall - wearing large man , with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son . both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes , and there 's no real plot to be seen . it 's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd , slightly macabre looney tunes- with far more gore , profanity , bloody violence , and occasional moments of hilarity . i bought the dvd along with eraserhead , having previously seen eraserhead . do n't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but . in fact , it seems to almost be a statement against such things , as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see . as lynch says , " if this is funny , it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all . "
2187	the small-scale film , in limited release , " waking ned devine " is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town .  filled with breathtaking scenery , 'characters' , and delightful music , the movie would be interesting even without a plot .  the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review .  the film starts out with a sharp opening , which gives us a taste of what is to follow : country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny .  what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town ( pop 52 ) of tullymore .  who that person is , and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ( ian bannen ) and michael ( david kelly ) .  part detectives , part scalawags , they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds .  the village consists of several amusing characters .  a clueless pig farmer , temporary priest , and a witch .  there's also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the up-and-up .  there are no hollywood touches to this film - except for the outer space introduction [ ! ] .  pacing is right .  towards the end , it runs a bit out of steam , but that's okay because for most of the 90 minutes we've been interested in the goings on .  a mixture of laughs and ( occasional ) sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged .  in one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists .  one of the key moments in the film .  the music , available on cd ( london 289 460 939-2 ) follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering .  a fine film that's for everybody except action fans .  somewhat like 'the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain , ' . . .  but livelier .  
2188	the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
2189	i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome .  never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan .  for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly .  the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well .  however , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect .  his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great .  like rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb .  now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men .  the trailer for the film sums it up quite well .  first strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them .  jackie chan is a regular comedian .  well , he's no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up .  for example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) .  even the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame .  but never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident .  with some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention .   ,

2203	roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor .  however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed .  maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) .  proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator .  when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle .  maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus .  gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required " 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence " style of moviemaking .  the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . .  it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting .  it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective .  the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed .  many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . .  all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled .  we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though .  there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing .  it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners .  some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . .  but i still don't know exactly how he did it .  russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity .  for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . .  but he should have it now .  from here on moviegoers should now be able to say , " let's go see the new russell crowe movie " .  he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum .  it's both rousing and chilling .  joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) .  commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly .  it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance .  oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world .  i've always been fascinated with reed . . .  he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years .  it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance .  the film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed .  reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed .  rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars .  ironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film .  anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell .  some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . .  and like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately .  it's sad that such a good film has these distractions .  movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects .  keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction .  however it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d .

2207	personally , i find the movie to be quite a good watch . it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized . not only that , it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police do n't just go all out and wipe out triads . overall , the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture . nevertheless , the movie stays true to the real world , thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens . i 'd recommend this movie to any triad / mafia movie fan . another good watch would be dragon squad . that movie has more guns than this , as in this movie there 's more knives than guns ( in fact i do n't remember seeing a single gun ) .

2212	the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate .  however , fate is not so easily bested , and alex's friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances .  essentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher .  unfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film .  as far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many .  there is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential " roller coaster " type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick .  unfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre .  the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death .  the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed .  if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick .  other than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable .  
2213	intelligent , stylish , and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films ! when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger , the victim 's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer . dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason . de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense . the finale and conclusion are especially ' nightmarish'.it 's a truly edge of your seat shocker . even more impressive though is de palma 's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own . dressed to kill is also a very erotic film , but mainly in a strangely beautiful way . pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film . the cast is another strong feature of this film . michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist . angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill - fated housewife . nancy allen 's performance as an involved street - walker is solid . a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son . many criticize de palma 's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception . but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality , as calling this film a ' rip - off ' would be degrading to a fine thriller . dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans . * * * * out of * * * *

2219	for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them .  sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver .  and not a particularly good one at that .  what went wrong ?  mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool .  early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic .  in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff .  prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another .  why ?  i haven't the foggiest .  i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply .  with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects .  it's possible that these " spies " could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored .  the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character .  god forbid .  woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals .  still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish .  cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) .  between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact .  the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us .  sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product .  thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight .  they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .  newton bats her eyes flirtatiously .  cruise grins a little too slyly .  the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film .  here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 .  he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) .  sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial " i'm the man ! "  charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .  mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop .  the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the " symbolic " pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) .  we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .  it isn't done any differently here .  the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .  he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie .  the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one .  when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort .  he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof .  i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers .  in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death .  the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) .  the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles .  though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a " so you thought i was dead . . . " .  not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat .  what a hero !  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot .  my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do .  the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next " special " effect .  i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video .  nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it .  as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing .  in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium .  it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character .  all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .

2223	accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .  one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .  rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .  in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .  yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .  ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .  but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .  his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .  the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many .  juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .  at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .  even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical .  with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .  yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .  hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .  there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .  but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .  in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .  bore is perhaps too strong a word .  but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full .

2236	capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made .  christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .  and nobody wins .  the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .  i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting .  christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan .  he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .  apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .  since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die .  let's stop and think about this for a second .  if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .  in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .  i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .  you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .  this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems .  lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .  they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .  the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them .  lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional .  the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .  in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .  what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .  also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany .  there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot .  by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care .  we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .  this movie bungles two out of three , badly .  
2237	five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake .  the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) .  hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . #  1521 ) .  two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here .  orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) .  yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too .  i'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all !  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability .  thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film .  the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .  any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .  the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens .  there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot .  while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress .  the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office .  i'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) .  the script for this film is completely pathetic .  the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .  the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .  here is an example of the wonderful dialog .  the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .  the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "  this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy .  now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented .  one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "  i'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get .  now lets talk about the great special effects for this film .  this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers .  the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence .  a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie .  are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ?  the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .  in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing .  very impressive trick !  the one ( half ? )  plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious .  the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film .  however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny .  in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down .  i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least .  oh well , win some , lose some .

2250	capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain .  his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse .  a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? "  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

2259	the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending .  watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise .  when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification .  this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more .  good surprises make movies fun to watch .  then there are the bad twists .  you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid .  screwed perfectly suits the latter description .  what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on .  by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs .  larry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing .  whoops .  screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments .  norm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich , old , insidious boss , miss crock ( elaine stritch ) .  when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day , willard is convinced by his best friend rusty ( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars .  too excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home .  now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping .  of course , everything that could go wrong does .  the first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad .  but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear .  the more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes .  at one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : " no , you idiot ! "  i'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film .  a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive .  they give real cops bad names .  also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days .  looking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief .  he just didn't belong in this movie .  macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte .  if you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel .  otherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money .

2271	it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office .  a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs .  in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie .  in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types .  the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together .  jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts .  the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one .  chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time .  chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance .  he works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines .  almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent .  we're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd .  cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters .  the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help .  the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective .  it's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up .  rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank .  there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback .  also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing .  however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background .  almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types .  a recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .  
2272	a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion .

2274	return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin , in which gordon liu played shan te , a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter . in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten . he imitates the original shan te , tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses . its a classic light hearted martial arts tale , with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang . the choreography is fantastic throughout , whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu 's performance , as are the others , particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander , more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films . but few have such a magical blend of slapstick , unique training and fighting , with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good . full of light hearted joy , its impossible not to give this the highest score .
2275	merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
2276	the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
2277	 " love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes .  at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .  danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his .  everything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .  much confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another .  sound confusing ?  it is .  i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .  in some respects , it works .  but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .  characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen .  the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister .  but so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them .  well , i didn't , at least .  one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza .  here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing .  here , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it .  i was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .  michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .  like i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline .   " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much .  the stars deserved better , and so did the audience .  
2278	i was aware of rohmer 's admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great cineasts , and that normal spectators generally considered as artistic failures ( as renoir 's or chaplin 's very last movies ; yes , the " politique des auteurs " also has its dark side ) . but with " les amours d'astrée et de céladon " , it 's as if rohmer himself wanted , for what may be his last movie , to perpetuate this tradition of great directors , who made a last senile movie , by adapting urfé 's " l'astrée " , with ridiculous aesthetic codes , witch just look like a parody of rosselini 's last movies ( the ones he made for tv from descartes or marx 's lives ) . in his version of " perceval " , rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re - transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things . the director apparently changed his mind when the xvii century is involved , and films actors , dressed like 1600 's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes . but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than luchini and its fake trees . it 's not that the story itself is stupid , but the way rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny ( and i 'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors , the annoying and sad humorist tries by rodolphe pauly , the ridiculous soft - erotic tone , the poor musical tentatives , or the strange fascination for trasvestisment ! ) . the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke , which mixes a soft - erotic movie made for tv with theological scholastic discussions ( sic ! ) . at the beginning of the movie , rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity , and that 's why he had to film " l'astrée " in other parts of the country . however , i 'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting , if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions . this film may interest a few historians , but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad rohmer 's movie .
2279	the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
2280	a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
2281	full of surprises . 
2282	director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama " when a man loves a woman , " but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , " message in a bottle , " which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up .  everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , " meaningful " statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through .   " message in a bottle " begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day .  inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper .  soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message .  of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner .  she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier .  do you think you know where this is headed ?  most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second .  if there are any positive things to say about " message in a bottle , " it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , " shaggy dog " love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city .  meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently .  it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .  the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the " friend " roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune .  the first half of " message in a bottle " plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time " getting to know " garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining .  usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt " written , " and not as if people were really " talking . "  when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble .  i swear that while watching " message in a bottle , " i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) .  always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing .  nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after .  this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , " city of angels . "  although theresa is deeply touched by the " heartfelt " letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began .  it should have read , " memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! "

2289	seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) .  when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word " routine . "  i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and " donnie brasco " clinches this idea .  it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .  the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .  we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .  he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .  somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him .  it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade .  i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .  however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .  the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .  the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .  most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .  thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .  much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .  pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .  he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .  we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .  newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .  as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .  most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .  the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .  the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .  back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering .  since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .  my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .  a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .  we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .  aside from a few minor , general flaws , " donnie brasco " manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .  it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful .

2291	part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes .  in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard .  phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises .  elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead  the two are careless hawaiian surf bums .  to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go .  after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot .  they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits .  rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along .  phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a .  j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) .  yellowstone has a problem .  it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs .  not just one or two . . . thousands of them .  the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) .  the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted .  instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm .  a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways .  the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny .  there's a moment when phil utters the line , " insert laugh here " , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience .  the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way .  instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way .  the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting .  instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films .  you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .

2296	'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed   ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday )  cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t .  walsh , jeff daniels  mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements  genre : drama  in my opinion :  in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is .  review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions .  the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant .  there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate .  put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for .  j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an " oldies " tv station ? or is it ?  i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed .  i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .  but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy " dollar theaters " after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced .  it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some " healthy " immorality is not a world at all .  instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right .  there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story .  now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be .  besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch .  the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable .  after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more .  a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork .  that said , the plot goes as such .  david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical " relationship " outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours .  they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today .  david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation .  but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home .  nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed .  and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them .  not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place .  people got hurt .  they cried .  they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well .  this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear .  i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better .  until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr

2303	bats is this year's camp flick .  with the world's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity .  as for the rest of us , well . . .  i'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway .  follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot .  i love alfred hitchcock's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based .  it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats .  when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate .  it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious .  why has he done this , you ask ?  because , you see , it is apparently a scientist's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind .  so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world .  of course , that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture .  consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave .  the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out .  what do they do ?  do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ?  nope .  they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes .  what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes .  we don't even get to see what's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick .  all we know is that bats are attacking .  how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery .  a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some .  of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it doesn't really go anywhere .  most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats ! "  some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept .  i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners .  playing such characters does not help actors' careers .  still , i suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is " so bad it's good , " you could do worse than bats .  it does have a tremendous amount of camp value .  i'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .  more power to them .

2306	capsule : an insult .  a stupid and incompetent movie that doesn't even have the benefit of being trashily enjoyable .  weslely and woody would do well to leave this off their resumes .  money train is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  it's not simply idiotic , it's contemptuous of its audience .  it tries to make us swallow things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit entirely .  it's a waste of wesley snipes and woody harrelson , who are enjoyable actors in their own rights but are nauseating here .  it's not even fun as trash .  woody and wesley star ( maybe that's not the right word ) as new york city transit authority police .  they have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout .  i had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking .  see if you can follow this .  they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the " money train " , the heavily armored car that picks up all the cash from the token books , is parked .  the guards on the train see this kid running at them , lift their machine guns , shout " halt ! "  and then open fire when the kid doesn't stop running at them .  blam , the kid's dead .  then woody and wesley show up , and of course the other ta cops hate them ( why ? ) , and a pushing match starts , and someone gets decked , and . . . i covered my face .  i'd seen enough .  i've never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy , systematically , any chance of being credible or interesting .  fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamned fault ) , woody and wesley hatch this plot about how to rob the money train .  hence the title , in case some of you ( all two of you ) didn't figure it out yet .  then there's this subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who wants his money .  there wasn't a minute when i gave a horse's ass about any of it .  neither woody nor wesley play characters that are interesting for a single minute .  we do not care about them .  they are not interesting .  they are noisy , loud , stupid , foolish jerks who whould have flunked out of the police academy .  they deserve to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be .  they only exist to rehash the kind of dynamics that was * written * into a movie like white men can't jump , and which simply does not exist here .  they are idiots , and we're expected to root for them .  bullcrap .  the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture .  what exactly is this mess ?  a cop movie ?  police procedure is not given a moment's genuine thought anywhere .  a thriller ?  the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite .  a comedy ?  the few jokes that do work are wasted .  a drama ?  all dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack .  there's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words .   ( actual dialogue excerpt : " fuck you . "   " what ? "   " you heard me : fuck * you * . "   " no : fuck * you * ! " )  look . i'll be honest here .  i've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i tried to pitch this mess , i'd get laughed out of the office .  anyone interested in hearing my ideas for a few good movies can write me and hear my pitch , because god knows i know i can do better .  i've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe .  
2307	though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
2308	costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
2309	even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection .  the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings .  it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) .  another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time .  this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) .  what helps final destination is its unique premise .  unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper .  this being already has predestined when and how you will die .  according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses .  what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it .  the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ?  this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers .  alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors .  alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off .  shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal .  however , death isn't through with them yet .  it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again .  the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while .  some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock .  creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films .  sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining .  also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously .  he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) .  the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie .  and from this , i had a great time watching the movie .  
2310	when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect .  woody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite .  even martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record .  kevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic " clerks " stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful " mallrats . "  i mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( " slacker , " " dazed and confused , " " before sunrise , " and " suburbia " . . . all  which were great ) .  now , i adore quentin tarantino .  his first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time .  but 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him .  he made way too many tv appearances .  he mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards .  and he made this film .   ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) .  robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one .  i've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them .  but in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts .  pitiful for any director , too .  now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out .  i've never seen all of " new york stories , " but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film .  exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel .  he's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) .  the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily .  as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile .  yea .   ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) :  the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt  this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue .  the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch .  the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! )  stuck inside some object in their hotel room .  the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it .  yeah , that's what i said .  stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully .  not even actually funny for a second .  my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! !  the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender  another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on .  ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at " coming back " ) who are playing sex games .  ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon .  but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much .  and david proval has never overacted as much .  and it's " pulp fiction " producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window .  a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . .  the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek  would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ?  nope .  luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her .  surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential .  it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny .  but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once .  antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny .  but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny .  but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time .  oh !  the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party .  antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it  was okay .  the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again )  ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film .  he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row .  they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light .  they also pay him a lot of cash .  this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy .  tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor .  it took quentin to realize that .  but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that .  if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars .  but this sucked .  it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good .  he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes .  that makes no sense .  it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven .  it's long and it's just not very good .  hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one .  conclusion : what's the moral here ?  if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece .  they should have re-watched " new york stories " and then stopped in their tracks .  none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap .  but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool " from dusk till dawn , " which i found exhilerating ) .  i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made " the man from hollywood " because it makes him seem more realistic and not some " god of cinema . "  i seem to respect directors if they aren't " gods " and are actually human beings who make mistakes .   " the man from hollywood " is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously .  
2311	stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
2312	there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere .  in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech .  at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers .  she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in .  drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there .  but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here .  in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken .  even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from .  the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister .  it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie .  the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls .  with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) .  he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls .  the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship .  it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home .  things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village .  it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there .  this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also .  but i doubt that .  the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel .  lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl .  the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets .  kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose .  the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film .  the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves .  the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her .  that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts .  it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence .  he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him .  the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god .  the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia .  the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by .  her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best .  she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey .  after all , the mystical trip is the journey .  the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings .  bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity .  the little girls are precocious but they are lovable .  julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them .  she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at .  this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being .  and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !  
2313	the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
2314	[director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
2315	a sci fi/comedy starring jack nicholson , pierce brosnan , annette benning , glenn close , martin short and other stars .  a warner bros picture  the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie .  before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like .  many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all .  how wrong they were .  i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema .  the story is about martians attacking earth .  using ray guns ( hooray ! )  they generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries .  nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials .  but , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth .  the way people are killed by the ray guns is great , they is a hillarous ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding .  but , most of all , this film is fun .  the martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable .  the film is a million times better then the dire independance day , and is a real tribute to the tacky '50s invasion movies .  they are is a great score by danny elfman , and lots of laughs .  this has to be the best invasion i've seen for a long time .

2319	you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema ? you 're stuck there in the best seat in the house , centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there , uncomfortable and itchy , thinking " when the f * * * is this film ever going to end ? ? ? " ( you know the feeling - think of a.i. and the village ) . well , visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling . i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start ! it is interminable ! so " arty " it hurts . this is the first miike takashi film i have watched . apparently he makes films by the dozen and , if they are all pretentious w@nk like this , i suspect it will be the last . i 'm not against pretentious w@nk . david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut - rate , cheap , and nasty pretentious w@nk .   as you may have worked out by now - i hated it .
2320	if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word " cute " but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a " cute " film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn't work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it's icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .

2323	the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode .  after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine .  after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world .  again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it .  the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' .  someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake .  that someone is death .  you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . .  but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve .  for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport .  alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air .  in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft .  after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky .  the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize .  but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances .  the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi .  before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . .  is that one helluva premise , or what ?  `final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong .  on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that .  unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool .  you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks .  young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' .  after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' .  low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent .  some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 .  `final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years .  not that the characters are that good .  sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend .  in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) .  aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) .  the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! '  toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . .  `spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments .  not so .  `final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening .  the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick .  the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) .  but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes .  creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise .  what will trigger the accident ?  will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ?   ( yeah , sick humor ) .  will it be the leaking toilet ?  the falling fishing reel in the corner ?  the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward .  a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach .  it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ?  it's fun .  in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea .  this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side .  after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you .  when will your ? design' expire ?  is death waiting around the corner ?  the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies .  
2324	on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail .  he says to a black congregation " . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . " )  well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy .  beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california .  the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action .  the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy .  when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days .  his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care .  first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name .  then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination .  his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements .  bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience .  he is hit hard with questions about his voting record .  he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up .  since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity .  they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made .  the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers .   ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j .  fans is not part of bulworth's " truth . "  that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie .  when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . )  the experience is liberating .  with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth .  he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway .  why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ?  bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on .  he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something .  chicken wings , appropriately enough .  bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives .  when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment .  with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product .   ( you go , warren ! )  when they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews .  that night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them .  he stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap .  the next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers .  from then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth .  his rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy .  he's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad .  his lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth .  eventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? )  overtakes the politics , which is too bad .  screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him .  there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer .  these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin .  still , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen .  as the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) .  as an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth .  as a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) .  someone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck .  it's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics .  after all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news .  just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants .  just don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies .

2336	barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets .  being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , " don't call me babe , " sound very ironic indeed .  from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe .  throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras .  this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire .  for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline .  it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) .  known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms .  in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom .  even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet .  there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of " barb wire . "  if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts .  who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ?  only a stuntwoman .  not pamela anderson lee .  
2337	cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
2338	it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . "   ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . "  it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither .  as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine .  even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .

2340	 " a breed apart " casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner .  a bit hard to swallow ?  that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film .  hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector .  turner is the woman caught between the two men .   " a breed apart " isn't a bad movie , exactly .  indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different .  the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies .  for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at " his " birds .  later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them .  i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point .  another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops .  i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner .  i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions .  however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds .  as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired .  he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters .  and this one is no exception .  he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow .  despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through .  for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early .  he comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions .  soon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us .   " a breed apart " isn't a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it's worth seeing for that reason alone .  
2341	this movie was banned in england ? why ? tom savini , george romero , dario argento , lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since ... this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80 's horror film . good looking girls ( who ca n't act to save their lives , by the way ) , a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour , a scythe , a crazy brother wandering around the family estate , and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end . but banned ? seriously . when the english parliament banned this movie , the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were . there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore ( which was greatly underdone ) . there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made , obviously . but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned . i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with . as it stands , the film is entertaining , but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result . banned ... what a joke ...

2348	vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .  while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence .  that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line .  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .  and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery .  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it .  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .  this has not always been carpenter's style .  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question .  jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows .  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) .  to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is .  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them .  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ?  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog .  now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona .  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing .  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .  that is not his style and it just does not work very well .  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .  these vampires do not maintain a low profile .  there are arguably logical flaws in the film .  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight .  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  perhaps i will read the book .  
2349	not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
2350	the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
2351	the first was good and original . i was a not bad horror / comedy movie . so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch it . what really makes this movie work is judd nelson 's character and the sometimes clever script . a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay . sometimes there 's scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a grainy - look . great made - for - tv movie . it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd nelson 's stanley doing what he does best . i suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel , just so you 'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background .
2352	a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 
2353	until i saw this special on hbo , i had never heard of eddie izzard . i sure am glad that i have now ! he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen ! rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie . i could not stop laughing for the entire show . if you like to laugh you have to see this special !
2354	the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
2355	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
2356	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
2357	a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
2358	like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
2359	kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
2360	for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
2361	could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
2362	first of all , this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it , everyone loves her , snobby girl intervenes , all looks lost , girl pulls through , everyone loves her again etc . throw in the fitting in thing , an attractive male crushing on the heroine , plus single - parent troubles and it 's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it . second of all , i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close - minded - in fact , i do n't recall the quote exactly , but i remember at one point in the movie , holly says , " why do they have to be so uptight ... so classical ? " it 's really insulting how label classical music in this way . third , i 've went over it dozens of times , but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears . there just is n't any point at all . and oh yeah , while the actress who portrayed holly ( i 'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not ) had a reasonably good voice , it was n't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting . she was oversupporting the whole time . 1/10 stars .
2363	[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together .

2365	alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure " the musketeer . "  for some reason that i may figure out later , i don't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of " the musketeer . "  it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film's xin-xin xiong ( " once upon a time in china " ) and yuen woo-ping from " crouching tiger , hidden dragon . "  the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well .  elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 " the three musketeers " ) , the man with no name from " a fistful of dollars " ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano .  the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the " matrix " crowd .  alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters .  the real problem with the " the musketeer " lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) .  chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma .  suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen .  if " the musketeer " makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons .  stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one .  the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive .  catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in " the princess bride ) .  stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character .  tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre .  he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout .  the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed .  peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well .  a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps .  photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before .  it is all routine stuff .  the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse .  it works in a sci-fi film like " the matrix " or in a classical fantasy like " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " but just calls attention to itself in " the musketeer . "  at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used .  it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed .  with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .  
2366	it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
2367	apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths . marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess . 
2368	the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
2369	poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
2370	working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
2371	seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats]  it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life .  all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do .  therefore , " gone with the wind " deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner .  it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself .  the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war .  this plays a major factor in the film's success .  to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy .  it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers .  can a story set so long ago be relatable now ?  the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them .  it doesn't simply plug in the " right thing " at the " right time , " it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant .  building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ?  we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time .  she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her .  right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be .  being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e .  who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e .  getting married just to spite someone ) .  the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him .  he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his .  her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see .  she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband .  her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense .  acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) .  he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation .  butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior .  he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition .  for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out .  this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that .   " do we have ammunition factories ?  do we have food ?  do we have a navy ?  all we have is tobacco . "  all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong .  butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing .  scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her .  but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever .  and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life .  the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is " marked " for life when her first husband dies .  this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story .  some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film .  in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance .  even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .  the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .  the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken .  the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .  fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .  one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , " no !  not my leg !  don't cut off my leg ! "  another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be .  as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north .  she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat .  this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .  most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .  each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other .  scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .  they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .  they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .  perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .  both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .  love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why .  gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .  all ?  none ?  either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings .  it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in " gone with the wind , " but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain .  
2372	a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
2373	there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
2374	the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate .  people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future .  after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds .  the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth .  the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element .  the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though .  this movie has very good special effects , for the most part .  the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well .  bruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city .  one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk .  this movie is about what happens .  the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations .  also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end .  some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag .  bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does .  the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down .  it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying " cool " followed by a " what the hell ? ! ? ! " .  i give the fifth element .

2381	the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
2382	to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery .  it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history .  it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible .  worse , there's the promise of a sequel .  why ? !  save your money .  some films go quickly to video .  this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . '  in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species .  most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) .  survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives .  the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons .  dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . '  travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth .  much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations .  he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter .  but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth .  when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan .  he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site .  it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it .  the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader .  a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how .  but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox .  this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment .  it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors .  `we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says .  `but first , we need a few more supplies . '  in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts .  by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl .  the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel .  numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning .  and after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree .  this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ?  at a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer .  both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity .  in addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga .  this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen .  the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder .  this led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages .  but the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable .  if the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader .  like terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave .  could that be the scientology message ?  
2383	boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
2384	it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

"  and i'll stand there staring 'til i get a straight answer .  sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter who's had some troubles a while back .  he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an " ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick " of a mechanic named darrell .  while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what's cooking .  is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ?  probably not .  bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues .  just as those issues are starting up , grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention .  just beats bobby silly .  bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace .  a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake .  them murderous arizonians .  gotta love 'em .  if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations .  you win a kewpie doll .  the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction .  but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals .  we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty .  we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak .  look at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick .  bobby as terminator ?  stretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic .  okay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas .  i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative .  i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub .  sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters .  the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on .  too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us . . . while  we sit through this mess of a film .  u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique .  it's the oliver stone you've always known .  robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures .  but pictures of what ?  i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film .  plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years .  oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at .  you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on .  your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it .  and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun .  that's fine .  but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one .  do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . )  do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world .  but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook .  there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun .  this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail .

2395	have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ?  or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ?  these thought-provoking questions are the subject of " final destination , " which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's " the sixth sense . "  stylishly filmed and tautly directed by " x-files " alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written " teen-speak , " rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue .  at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris .  progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious " coincidences , " including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song " rocky mountain high " over the sound system in the airport bathroom .   " john denver died in a plane crash , " alex grudgingly mutters to himself .  once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off .  arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates .  as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners .  carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate .  alex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents .  the teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker .  only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life .  that is only the setup of " final destination , " and the less said about what follows , the better .  suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself .  the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and " final destination " surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years .  graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away .  devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , " idle hands , " is even more of a charismatic presence here .  the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part .  one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful .  ali larter ( 1999's " varsity blues " ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father .  the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional .  the movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles .  tony todd ( 1992's " candyman " ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory .  and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy .  ultimately , what is so good about " final destination " is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films .  if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .

2398	written by mark rosenthal and lawrence konner  starring charlize theron , bill paxton , david paymer  as reviewed by james brundage  i'm beginning to get fed up .  over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films .  the good balances the bad .  i try to see both in equal proportions .  but disney's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i haven't seen a truly terrible movie .  it's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while .  and , you know what , mighty joe young doesn't qualify .  far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie .  it's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i've been seeing in every movie since a bug's life .  mighty joe young tracks a 2 , 000 pound gorilla in the wilds of africa that is taken to a reserve in . . .  california ?   . . .  for safe-keeping .  okay .  a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism .  the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist-esque hatred of poachers woman-of-the-wild motif .  the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all .  mark one down .  i'm feeling relaxed .  it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un-creative movie .  but , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should .  so that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment .  this is not the film to take a girl on a date to .  it's not the film for you .  it's the film for you and your family .  when you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away .  the same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick .  it becomes fun .  all you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch .

2406	libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood .  just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent .  she's convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) .  time passes , and the friend disappears with matty .  during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell " daddy ! "  and realizes that her husband is still alive .  libby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the " double jeopardy " amendment she can off him with impunity ) .  when she gets parole , she's sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident .  after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty .  travis pursues , naturally .   " double jeopardy " is a watered-down version of " the fugitive , " with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona .  although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script .  character development is thin .  travis' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story .   ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick .  it's a long way to go for one line ) .  there's considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there's something " the fugitive " didn't have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere .  libby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics .  this is judd's most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen .  let's hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around .  the quality of director bruce beresford's movies seems to depend on luck .  when he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like " 'breaker' morant , " " driving miss daisy , " and " tender mercies . "  when he doesn't .   .   .  we get " double jeopardy . "  screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on " the rock , " a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites .  bottom line : ashley judd tries hard but can't save this predictable bore .

2412	any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master .  any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it " more accessible " to the general public .  or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 .  human traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done .  the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts .  the cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy .  koop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men .  nina herself can't stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends .  lulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip's best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends .  and moff ( danny dyer ) can't seem to escape the black hole of his awful life .  the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background .  human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan's subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action .  the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters .  dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident .  however , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed .  human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene .  instead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace .

2422	" midnight cowboy " is one of those films that s been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in america . its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial . no wonder it was a huge success when initially released . but be warned , its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made . the characters are memorable , well - developed , and ultimately tragic . the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending , something which was basically mandatory by the 80s . still , this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film . its a time when well - made , innovative , and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer . all this was over by the time " star wars " was released . the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work . it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing . unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects , " midnight cowboy " has aged quite well . its still as powerful now as it was when initially released . the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece . the characters ' backgrounds are never fully explained , but the performances make them completely developed . both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions ) . plus , being a fan of vintage exploitation films , i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street . " midnight cowboy " is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made . ( 10/10 )

2428	capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension .  alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen .  it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her .  in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp .  a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning .  at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home .  unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod .  the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent .  ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not .  the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against .  lice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) .  at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way .  one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck .  worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated .  what's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack .  the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it .  in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie .  it's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it .

2431	after enduring mariah carey's film debut , glitter , i'm reminded of a bit from chris rock's bigger and blacker .  in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that don't mean it should be done . "  to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done .  sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter .  everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .  start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie .  the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .  worse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .  meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .  influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star .  in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie's on " the roller coaster of superstardom . "  in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .  i won't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .  you'll figure it out .  the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could've been fun .  but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .  what a mistake .  the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons .  instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes .  which brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said .  mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .  she actually looks scared during her one love scene .  but you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse .  so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey's virginal target audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .  even the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly .  they're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , " oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "  everyone in the film is a device , and it's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .  to say more would be a waste .  there's so much wrong with this film .  and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she's likely to get .  but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .  
2432	the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states . there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show . this is simply the worst show ever made , with awful actors , dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous . the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves , since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense . kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage .
2433	 " nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy "  showgirls ( nc-17 ) - contains graphic nudity , profanity , sexual situations and violence .  some people , however , keep their clothes on .  you do not watch porn films for their intellectual values , nor do you write reviews on them .  that's why this review will be short .  it seems that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video stores .  there is no story , script , point or acting .  only naked bodies , which is exactly the point .  here is the so called plot : nomi , the 23-year-old with a dark past as a hooker , has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder and a big , fake smile .  no one is twisting nomi's arm .  no one is holding her grandmother hostage .  she wants to do this .  and that is what she is doing till the end credits .  so what's the problem then ?  what's the point ?  what's the film about ?  is there anyone whose aspirations could inspire less sympathy ?  this film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck .  believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody .  elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas' script .  her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better .  her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the industry , selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public .   " i am not a whore !  i am a dancer " , she screams , but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing .  in fact the acting in " showgirls " brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level .  not one single achievement , besides the conventional cinematography , is worth mentioning .  it is a total waste of time and money .  there is not a single moment of what you might call intelligence .  the dialogue is structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after another .  its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a catastrophe .   " in my films , " writes director paul verhoeven ( 'basic instinct' , 'total recall' ) , " i hold the mirror up to life . "  well , excuse me ?  his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas , and as he put it " show the naked truth " , is simplified and unreal .  occasionally , between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities , screenwriter joe eszterhas ( the creator of some of the worst screenplays in hollywood history ) inserts some lines of deep morality , that sound something like this : " hey , i see you .  i see that you're hiding " - " from what ? "  - " from you " .  yes , and even the only decent line in this film : " nomi is what las vegas is all about " can't save 'showgirls' from going under .  it's a strange phenomena .  it's not erotic , because it lacks sensuality .  not dramatic , because it lacks the acting .  and not intelligent because it lacks a story .  it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography .  you want to see naked women ?  bare breasts ?  full frontals ?  it's nothing wrong with that .  but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store , and not waste time surviving through eszterhas' pathetic dialogue .  b qualities , while it's only a high budget porn-film .

2437	forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented " carter's way " .  he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .

2442	' shock corridor ( 1963 ) ' was my first film from samuel fuller , and there i was impressed with the director 's astute blending of b - movie and big - budget aesthetics , even if the story itself was pure schlock . ' pickup on south street ( 1953 ) ' was released a decade earlier in fuller 's career , obviously produced on a larger budget from a big - name studio , twentieth century - fox . nevertheless , the visuals are still notable in that there 's a somewhat raw , naturalistic element to the photography , not unlike dassin 's ' the night and the city ( 1950 ) ' and kazan 's ' panic in the streets ( 1950 ) ' { the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald}. in some scenes , fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors ' faces that they 're out of focus , bluntly registering the intimate thoughts , emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features , the eye . though ( unexpectedly ) prone to melodrama , and with just a hint of anti - communist propaganda , ' pickup on south street ' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of new york city . when just - out - of - prison pickpocket skip mccoy ( richard widmark ) snags the purse of a woman on the subway ( jean peters ) , he pockets more than he 'd originally bargained for . the woman , candy , and her cowardly ex - boyfriend joey ( richard kiley ) had been smuggling top - secret information to the communists , and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro - film . will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities , or sell it to the highest bidder ? if ' pickup on south street ' has a flaw , it 's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti - communist agenda , reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii { dwight taylor , who supplied the story , also notably wrote ' the thin man goes home ( 1944 ) , ' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. for no apparent reason , every identifiable character  even the smugly self - serving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a self - sacrificing patriot , the transformation predictable from the outset . in traditional film noir , the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance , the rational punishment for his sins , but apparently not when they 've served their country ; patriotism wipes the slate clean . richard widmark , an actor who i 'm really beginning to like , plays the haughty pickpocket with composure , though always with that hint of ill - ease that suggests he 's biting off more than he can chew . the opening scene on the train is the film 's finest , as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim 's hand bag , recalling bresson 's ' pickpocket ( 1959 ) . ' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street - woman who 'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it ( though , of course , she draws the line at commies ) . jean peters is well - cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side , playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour ; fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow - legged strut of a prostitute . nevertheless , peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film 's attempts at realism . fascinatingly , upon its release , ' pickup on south street ' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi , and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite . go figure .

2449	the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film .  it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction .  that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller .  the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense .  our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division .  his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation .  complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee .  general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in .  teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid .  if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems .  scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze .  director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw .  it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them .  characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans .  west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter .  he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits .  bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell .  the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) .  there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another .  indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : " shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? " ) .  even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers .  goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies .  dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script .  it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) .  by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun .  it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five .  goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .

2457	various films seen at the seattle film festival :  it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles  a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft .  while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set .  impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians .  sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham's story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent  after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago .  this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " .  this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script .  the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel .  swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie .  unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script .  the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for .  still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds .  a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it .  the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza  this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids .  it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it .  perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light .  nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter .  as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over .  not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done .  all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats .  boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ?  add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .  some gore .  don't bring children to this one .  don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped .  blech .   . no fun whatsoever .  meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled  this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money .  his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans .  meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany .  after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany .  of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there .  the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .  still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .  c -- $2 . 50 .  the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements  after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :  1 ) be wary of french comedies .  these people like jerry lewis .  2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .  3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching .  4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out !  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task .  well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards .  it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .  lots and lots of horses .  the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .  unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .  highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) .  the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway .  actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life .  grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks .

2495	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
2496	this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
2497	the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
2498	even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
2499	the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
2500	dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london .  to boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story .  movies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it .  alex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly .  at times it moves beyond film into artwork .  it is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? .  these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning .  they are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight .  during this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) .  without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him .  i don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him .  it ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography .  murdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight .  shadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine .  we see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song .  a great entrance .  however , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied .  the city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching .  blade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience .  it is discussed it and argued , therefore a success .  other science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy .  we ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element .  dark city is not so easily explained away .  as the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task .  where is reality ?  dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films .  perhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger .  anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it .  
2501	the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
2502	i totally agree with the review by a reviewer of variety that the film is never quite as funny , lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant . narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic . if the film is supposed to be character - driven the poor lighting does n't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors . many non - south africans will have difficulty in following the spoken english in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process . i watched the film at the cape town world cinema festival last year . comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past . unfortunately bunny chow wo n't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the south african new wave , but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history . not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng . it has clearly limited appeal among south african audiences .
2503	passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
2504	had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
2505	disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
2506	being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently .  after all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago .  so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it .  i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration .  but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound .  after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen .  based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e .  lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever .  bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army .  lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i .  shot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic .  it is absolutely breathtaking .  using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes .  every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land .  david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today .  after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , " i've got to do a remake of this film ! "  but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : " okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert .  we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice .  and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . "  yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago .  but at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .

2513	my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list .  what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere .  firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies .  as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are " smokejumpers . "  we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from " cosmopolitan . "  having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest .  when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble .  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles .  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people .  miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away .  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building .  as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face .  our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse .  this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make .  the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ?  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved .  yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway .  not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .   ( " hoods in the woods , " is what the " ground-pounders " yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . )  along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor .  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .  using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .  when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey .  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .  the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , " it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "  firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 .  it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .  
2514	a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
2515	the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
2516	deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie .  this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive .  but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit .  braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) .  their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket .  however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables .  braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives .  braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie .  kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful .  the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises .  however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost .  take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled .  the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot .  for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable .  there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation .  they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay .  the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable .  not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught .  what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ?  writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound .  but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .  
2517	 " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
2518	i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime , though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks . although i personally would n't have crossed live - action with animation , it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters . the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country . i would have to say that the casting was brilliant . angela landsbury made a perfect miss price , while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest . endings always surprise me and this was no exception . it was neither happy nor sad , though i do not know if this was intentional . the dialog was n't great , but considering it was designed to be a kid 's movie , that is alright . overall , i would give the performance nine out of ten , the dialog six out of ten , the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten .
2519	the muppet movie is the first , and the best movie among the ever-growing list of muppet movies .  the muppet movie tells the story of how our hero , kermit the frog , came to be a star .  a delightful movie for all ages , the muppet movie is * bursting * with cameo appearances by countless hollywood stars of the 80's and today .  the muppet movie begins in a movie theater , where all of the muppet stars are anxiously awaiting the first showing .  once everyone is settled down , the movie inside of the movie begins .  it starts out with kermit in a swamp , playing his banjo and singing ( this shot required jim henson to spend hours underwater ) .  kermit is discovered by bernie , a big-time hollywood agent who happens upon kermit by accident .  bernie believes that kermit holds much potential to become a big star in hollywood .  kermit ponders the idea of becoming a big movie star , where he could " make millions of people happy " .  kermit decides to leave his swamp and make the trip out to hollywood .  along the way , kermit befriends his now famous muppet companions , beginning with fozzie bear , who had been spending his days doing stand-up comedy at the el sleezo cafe , owned by james coburn .  the two decide to team-up and continue on their way to hollywood .  but , doc hopper ( charles durning ) , the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea .  he wants kermit to be his spokesman , but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants .  the trip continues , with kermit and fozzie meeting miss piggy , rowlf , gonzo , the electric mayhem band , and more muppets who all share the same wish : to make it to hollywood .  oh , and even more celebrities continue to appear .  kermit and miss piggy continue to get to know each other a little better , including a rather funny scene at a restaurant with steve martin as the waiter .  eventually , kermit and the group make it to hollywood .  that is , after kermit is finally able to elude doc hopper and proclaim his freedom .  lord lew , a big-time hollywood producer portrayed by orson welles , gives kermit his shot at stardom and gives him the go-ahead to produce a movie .  the muppet movie is definitely a movie that is fun for all ages .  it is also a sure-deal as one parents can watch , and enjoy along with their kids .  
2520	rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
2521	ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here !  it's title : starship troopers .  and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .  i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .  after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review .  starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .  in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether .  while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : " the 'star wars' of the 90s . "  am i being to generous to this film ?  perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .  in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a " kick-the-aliens'-asses " style .  id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .  this new " star wars " has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species .  the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects .  however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .  more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .  and they should be .  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film .  this is an " event " film , but surprisingly above average .  it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .  starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange " join the army " ads .  mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original .  stating , " would you like to know more ? " ,  these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .  however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .  after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .  we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .  rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .  however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .  however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .  unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy .  this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .  and as a result , dizzy signs up .  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .  in reality , i found myself watching a space version of " melrose place , " but with better special effects .  an hour into the film , the war begins .  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with .  the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .  following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .  the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .  many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks .  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .  the troopers are ordered to locate the " brain " and capture it .  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .  it's about special effects and gory violence .  director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .  starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon .  the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .  my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .  the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .  despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .  while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .  thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .  to most guys , he will come across as artificial .  fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .  her dizzy is extremely likeable .  denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .  jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .  neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .  however , he does give a good performance .  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .  his performance rises above the rest .  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .  unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .  director verhoeven is the main star of the film .  his direction is fast and unrelentless .  he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .  the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .  the dialogue is smart but not too smart .  we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .  thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .  amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .  in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .  i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .  oh , and the special effects are first rate .  starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film .  it is extremely violent .  in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .  however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .  it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .  and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .  now that would be entertaining !

2538	thanks jymn magon , for creating disney 's 2 best cartoons ever . this show has improved very much over the years . as a kid , i did n't like it because i thought it was a rip - off of ducktales , which was my favorite disney thing at the time ( like grandmoffromero ) . then later on though it was good but not great . but after reading the reviews here , i decided to give it another chance & bought the dvd set & watched the whole pilot the first day i got it , & was very pleasantly surprised . it 's still my favorite episode , although the series did live up to it . and by the end of disc 1 , i knew this was going to be a top tenner . the characters are so complex & charming . my favorite has got to be wildcat . he 's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot . my next favorite is baloo , the best pilot on the show . i can see why ' ol jymn built the show around him . then it 's kit cloudkicker . he & baloo have the best relationship in the series . after that , louie . jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice . after him , rebecca . she has made me laugh pretty hard , and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry . and finally(for the heroes ) , molly . although she 's my least favorite , i still like her . i think she 's a very cute character(much better than webby from ducktales ) . and the villains were very original . don karnage & his air pirates always crack me up , kahn is ice - cold and ruthless , and the thembrians are always at least amusing . as said before , the stories range from hilarious(time waits for no bear , romance of red chimp ) to nothing short of touching(the old man & the seaduck , paradise lost ) , to fun , funny & exciting adventures(in search of ancient blunders & my favorite for whom the bell klangs ) . these are only a few of my favorite episodes . anyway , talespin is disney 's best , aside from gummi bears some reasons for this ? gb had a decent amount of my favorite character(cubbi ) , while ts did n't have enough of wildcat . but in the end talespin remains a classic . bottom line- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever .
2539	the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script , inspired performances , a great sense of humor , a large and wonderful cast , and the beautiful scenery of vancouver .  it's a movie of weddings , marriage , family , infidelity , and--oh yes--love .  like 3 men and a baby , cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975's cousin , cousine .  the plot is complicated , but it goes something like this .  larry and tom are cousins , each of whom is not-so-happily-married .  tom starts an affair with larry's wife , tish , and to get even , larry and tom's wife , maria , pretend to have an affair of their own .  soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running .  cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures .  the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role , and virtually every performance deserves mention .  ted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity .  while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on " cheers , " he is also complex and vulnerable , with more between his ears than empty space .  as maria , isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy , sensuous , and immensely alluring .  sean young is perfectly cast as larry's picture perfect wife , tish , a superficial and trendy make-up consultant .  keith coogan , from adventures in babysitting , is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry's rebellious son , mitch .  and finally , lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch's rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins' best lines and laughs .  like moonstruck , cousins is a mix of drama and comedy .  the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd .  it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug .  how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other , as friends and as lovers ?  well , to its credit , cousins is just such a movie .  let's hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins

2543	double exposure was a tremendous surprise . it contains outstanding acting ( particularly from the underrated callan ) , fine cinematography and a compelling storyline . in other words , it 's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s . callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models , at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother ( who happens to be missing an arm and a leg ) . when the models callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead , the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing . this film never received the praise it deserves . most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time , but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot . it 's clever and unique , which is n't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre , but it 's also passionately crafted and performed . double exposure is a gem of its kind .
2544	miramax " disinvited " on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 .  they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning .  you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news .  no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise .  something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car .   ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , " 100% cotton " , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . )  of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ?  the backseat ?  the next car ?  thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering .  what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff .  our other surviving regulars have become estranged .  sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , " stab 3 " , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program .  murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of " stab 3 " , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death .  the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people .  scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive .  ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume .  with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent .  conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying " all bets are off ! "  in reference to the " rules " of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating .  with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of " stab 3 " ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven .  craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects .  how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny .  it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) .  the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before .   ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? )  finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent .  sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score .  i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs .  the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' .

2549	tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy .  robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss .  he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city .  there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona .  there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers .  of course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce .  although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all .  this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run .  it's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties .  even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy .  there also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce .  in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy .  in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all .  towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any ,  the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across .  and although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own .  lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell .  however , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player .  in fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier .  nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however .  the humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this .  the characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect'  nothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film .  he nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose .

2559	andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . "  they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .  like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .   " evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to " the top " ) .  webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .  here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .  it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .  the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .  after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this .  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .  this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down .  okay , it is a let-down .  i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good .  but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .  in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless .  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .  for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off .  however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .  from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .  no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .  we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .  more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .  juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .  >from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden .  but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .  that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .  describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .  alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .  his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .  and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " don't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .  madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .  at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .  her death , though , is brilliant .  her singing could be better though .  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard .  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti  lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .  but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .  antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .  his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .  he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .  although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .  like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's " everyone says i love you " ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

2579	note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue .  embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters .  fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing .  the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly .  we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft .  as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy .  more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation .  it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride .  played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights .  it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour .  whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful .  though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly .   ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . )  double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs .  surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film .  however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel .  the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat .  subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale .  one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla .  two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious .  if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film .  he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered .  it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to " get [his] shit together " is disquieting in its resonance .  while mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles .  ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman .  she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry .  meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing .  she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox .  the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout .  two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors .  while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner .  two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends .   " i'm an actor , " he tells them at one point , using the ol' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense .   " actors lie . "  but not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington .  
2580	there is a striking scene early in " city of angels , " where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise .  the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black .  then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up .  you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch .  it is an important scene for several reasons .  first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible .  the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference .  there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like " angels in the outfield " ( 1994 ) or " michael " ( 1996 ) .  the angels here are stark and believable .  this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air .  there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well .  they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven .  like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure .   " city of angels " is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) .  he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven .  maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies .  angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough .  he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance .  he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to " fall " and become human .  he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( " n . y . p . d .  blue " ) in a touching and humorous performance .  sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children .  of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it .   " city of angels " is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film " wings of desire . "  wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened .  the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human .  and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage .  this may be because director brad silberling ( " casper " ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( " blink " ) wanted to make " city of angels " its own movie - inspired by " wings of desire , " but not an attempt to copy it .  and yet , " city of angels " is not a typical hollywood movie .  it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( " the english patient " ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world .  seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by .  while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are .  both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances .  ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch .  cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have .  what is most striking about " city of angels " is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging .  it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time .  it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance .  instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive .  ____________________________________________ visit " charlie don't surf !

2581	gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
2582	the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
2583	possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk .  it smashed u . s box office office records in it's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here .  but is it any good ?  in a word , no .  i'll elaborate further .  the story is as follows .  apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on .  one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened .   ( see jurrasic park . )  imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago .  realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island .  enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there .  so , basically , what you have is this .  two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them .  a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem .  it's crap .  over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky .  add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested .  it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? '   ( yes , you should ) .  it's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park .  with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c . g . i  dinosaurs ( the t . rex's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world .  a very dissapointing sequel , indeed .  
2584	this is not horror , as the first part was : this is ( " campy " ) light and humorous entertainment . like in so many sequels , the action starts right away with no explanations . but there 's boobs , so i do n't complain . and real boobs that is . if i understand correctly , those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u.s. of a. which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela " bruce 's sister " springsteen . this can not be thought without the first movie , so i compare this to it . again there is too small clothing ( mainly pants ) and funny hair , it 's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . again there is really strange characters , this time even more visibly " pathological " ones . especially the personnel of the camp . it 's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . people are older : most of the actors must be at least 25 , but i think they 're supposed to be 16 or something . some " methods " used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant . actually this movie do n't have much in common with the first part , and this is worse than it in every way .
2585	nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
2586	in " the 13th warrior , " arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king's old lady .  with his translator ( screen legend omar sharif in a small role ) , ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen ( vikings ) .  he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king .  a messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance .  a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider .  thus , ahmed becomes the " 13th warrior . "  on the trip , ahmed manages to learn the vikings' language by listening to their fireside conversations .  a bit far-fetched , it's true , but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting .  ahmed , who's called " ibn " by the vikings , forms friendships with herger the joyous ( dennis storh ? i ) and the viking leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich ) .  when they arrive in the other kingdom , the thirteen warriors discover that they're facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves .  hereafter , most of the movie is battle scenes : the cannibals attack the vikings , the vikings attack the cannibals , the cannibals attack the .   .   .  well , you get the idea .  just to add some action , there's also a viking vs . viking duel .  other movies insert scenes between the fights ; these scenes are called character development .  i suspect that " the 13th warrior " had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team direction .  the movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan ( you'll notice a lot of similarities between " warrior " and mctiernan's " predator , " including the chittering jungle sounds ) .  somewhere along the line , mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over .  crichton , whose novel " eaters of the dead " is the basis for " warrior , " has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction " thrillers " : " westworld , " " coma , " " looker , " " runaway . "  their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie .  perhaps what " the 13th warrior " needs more than anything else is a villain .  the " eaters of the dead " are a faceless mob in blackface .  they have no personality , and by the end they don't even seem particularly threatening .  the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression .  mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain ; it was his " die hard " that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil roles in action films .   " the 13th warrior " suffers from a lack of vision .  it wants to be " predator " meets " braveheart " meets " the magnificent seven " meets " dances with wolves . "  with so many competing goals , all it can do is echo what it might have been .  it might have been a satisfying action film .  it might have been a beautifully-rendered medieval epic .  it might have been a thought-provoking examination of the meeting of cultures .  what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular .  bottom line : if you want to see antonio swing his sword , rent " the mask of zorro . "  
2587	gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement .  as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true .  gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . "  tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream .  so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ?  it's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) .  while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else .  the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times .  green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy .  but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ?  a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs .  younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense .  by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness .  while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .  rip torn , what were you thinking ?

2591	pegg has had a few hits in the past few years , starting with " shaun of the dead " in 2004 , movie on to " hot fuzz 2007 " , early 2008 he came out with " run fat boy run " and now comes this , " how to lose friends and alienate people " which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy 's of the year . the film is about sidney yound , a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity 's mostly because he is not one of them . anyway , one of the most successful magazine owners ( played by jeff bridges ) invites him ( out of nostalgia ) to work at his magazine . sidney is of course excited and moves to america , there he meets a girl currently writing a book , and hilarity ensues . this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future . pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i ca nt wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy " paul " . i rate this film 81 % .
2592	the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor .

2594	her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
2595	this is a run - of - the - mill nature porn movie . by porn , i do n't mean sex . i mean gratuitous images of ( for example ) thousands of birds together , or hundreds of walruses , or a giant waterfall or iceberg . several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer , to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film . there is almost no plot in this film . told to expect a story of three animal families , " better than march of the penguins " , the movie simply does n't deliver . the blame rests in three key areas : ( 1 ) the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to narrate in nature film history , ( 2 ) the music team who over - dramatized everything to tell you what you should be feeling , even when the film fails to motivate , and lastly but most importantly ( 3 ) the editors who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason , no continuity , no flow , sucking the life out of the entire film -- a film about life . when we got to the whales halfway through the film , i sunk back in my seat with dread , hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through , and that i 'd be able to survive the long endurance test along with the animals on screen . there was also almost no science in the film at all . they attributed hot and cold ( all of it , not just the seasons ) solely to the earth 's tilt , ignoring the fact that we 'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm . and it would be worst if we had no rotation ( relative to revolution ) like mercury , because half the planet would bake and the other half would freeze . then near the end they used the phrase " humans and animals " , as if humans are not animals , somehow exempt from the laws of nature . so much for science . i must credit the camera work , however , and again that is why i call this nature porn . everything from super - slow - motion to what appears to be a finely - tuned mechanically - controlled time - lapse photography , was put to use to provide some ( and i caution , only " some " ) stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films . that said , i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen . some of the shots showing the great watering hole in africa , as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me . a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it 's all natural , but they did n't do that . for a film about earth , i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown . what we saw was pristine . we had to take the narrator 's word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes . they did n't show us evidence of it . they did n't show us alberta 's poisonous tailing ponds visible from space . they did n't show us the great pacific trash whorl . they did n't show us a nighttime picture of human light pollution around the planet . these are as much earth as anything else . why cover it up for a feel - good whitewash ?   my last criticism of the content is of predation . any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey , the music turned almost into that mt doom scene from lord of the rings , with the predator portrayed as some kind of sauron ultimate - evil character . but predators are n't evil . they perform a necessary service , ensuring that the best members of the prey species survive . we are predators ourselves . any time the predator caught the prey , we immediately cut away to something else , to sort of pretend that death and eating do n't really happen . the final insult was the " dad " polar bear being left to die after he dared to try to eat . " bad bear ! bad ! " , you can almost hear them say . on to the presentation itself . my theatre may be in part to blame for this , but maybe not . i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own hdtv lcd at home . but the picture was blurry , and was presented in the same 16:9 ratio i could get at home , instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days . and during one action - packed scene near the end , the film ( i ca n't imagine this happening digitally , from how it looked ) was damaged , and we lost several of the colors , eventually blacking out completely . that repeated about three times . if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf , it will have been worth it . but how will i know ?
2596	disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center .  great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack .   ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy .  some lack lyrical snap .  others need more memorable melodies .  boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? )  so , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored .  the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble ! " ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments .  while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas .  directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn , who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black .

2611	synopsis : in this cultural exploration , a chinese american computer engineer named fang ( peter wang ) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his sister mrs . chao ( shen guanglan ) , her husband mr . chao ( hy xiaoguang ) , and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation .  fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along , both of whom don't speak chinese .  the encounter between the two families allows the audience to compare the eastern and western cultures as well as the ambitions of individual characters .  opinion : sometimes a film is plot driven .  sometimes it's a character sketch .  a great wall ( 1986 ) can be called a culture sketch , as opposed to a character sketch because it gently compares a chinese american family to a beijing family .  fang's family is thoroughly americanized .  fang is an upper middle class professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss .  his wife can't cook chinese .  his son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when fang encourages him to befriend an asian girl .  meanwhile fang's beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit . '  her husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of american depravity ( homosexuals running the streets ) , and her daughter lili longs for american freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance exams is the most important thing in life .  the two families spend a month slowly learning about each other .  there is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after the month-long vacation .  the film is neither here nor there ; it's a neutral , meandering , gentle , portrait of life on both sides .  
2612	the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
2613	a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
2614	one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen . i wanted to vomit after watching it . i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800 's . what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered , human birth , branding . oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself was n't too bad , but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom . the story itself was ok . the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy . they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800 's . but if you have a choice , do not see this movie .

2622	hedwig ( john cameron mitchell ) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin .  as a teen seeking his " other half , " he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g . i .  luther ( maurice dean wint ) .  the operation , performed by a hack surgeon , is botched , and the " angry inch " is all that's left .  now a " she " , hedwig comes to america , is abandoned by luther , forms a rock band and falls for her 17-year old lover/prot ? g ? , tommy , only to be rejected by him later , too .  she and her band , the angry inch , shadows the now-famous tommy gnosis across the us ( for revenge ? ) , but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in " hedwig and the angry inch . "  first time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie .  and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character .  mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for .  i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals .  sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse's " all that jazz " and " cabaret , " but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea .   " hedwig and the angry inch " is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from " the rocky horror picture show " and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols .  the original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it's not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun .  the audience i saw " hedwig " with thought so , too .  the main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star .  john cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love .  as a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g . i .  father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that " mother would make me play in the oven " where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio .  later , as a young man , he meets luther , another g . i .  and is swept off of his feet .  the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after .  flash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy .  frustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd " job " to make ends meet .  she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born .  she meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation .  jealous and angry , hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy's tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs .  hedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing .  things finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city .  the popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for " hedwig . "  the wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been .  it is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its " internationally ignored " rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role .  there isn't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of " rent " as a puerto rican drag queen .  the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film .  attention to details - hedwig's costumes and outrageous " cabaret " -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget .   " hedwig and the angry inch " may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch .  if you're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw .  i give it a b+ .

2625	ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .  these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .  if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .  to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore .  those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " .  this is the section for mistakes in the movies .  well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " .  and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .  the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .  more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .  miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .  the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .  he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .  the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .  dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .  oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .  really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said .  it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .  thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .  this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .  to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .  if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .  although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .  hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time .  
2626	this movie is simply awesome . it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb . this movie did not create any controversy in india ( as far as i know ) and its publicity was also kept low . initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing ... most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka , mangal pandey , loc etc .. there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added . but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie ( also a must watch ) . if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor ( producer ) and firoz abbas khan ( the director ) for making such a great movie ..

2631	bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  the odd couple ii  grumpy old men , it ain't .  hell , my fellow americans , it ain't .  walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years .  odd couple ii feels terribly generic , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale .  that's like repackaging campbell's soup in a generic food can , really .  how writer neil simon could've made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me .  throughout the movie , i really didn't laugh once .  honestly .  i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn't seem funny to me .  and that car rolling off the cliff ?  the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it .  and the ending gets all super-mushy , too .  in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a wasted jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon's daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands .  ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i'm sure .  consider it a hospitable gester , you won't waste your time renting this muck .

2635	this was a crappy movie , with a whole lotta non - sense and too many loose - ends to count . i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ( ron livingston ) made a cameo in it , and i continued watching it because as a girl , i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change . later , i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get , and each time it got ... more ... ridiculous . sean crawley ( good - looking chris l. mckenna , whom i 've never seen before - but loved his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter , when he meets electrician duke wayne ( george wendt from " cheers " ) . thinking he 's getting more work from duke , sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews ( daniel baldwin , playing a stereotypically evil guy ) . ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant ( ron livingston in a cameo , who i 've been in love with from " office space " up to " sex & the city " ) . ray end up offering the apparently desperate - for- cash sean $ 13k to kill the accountant , and sean accepts the job . sean stalks out the accountant , whose wife ( kari wuhrer ) he finds himself attracted to , completes the hit , and leaves - taking the file of information against ray with him . sean quickly learns he was being used , that ray never intended to pay him , and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money . up to this point , it 's a descent flick ... generally worth watching . but as soon as ray , duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him , it just got dumber and dumber ( and still dumber ... ) , until finally it seemed like the film 's writer , charlie higson , had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something . without simply detailing the movie , let 's just say that in every - single - scene you watch after the kidnapping , you find yourself gasping " what the f**k ! , " baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption . in the end , so many loose - ends are left in the movie , that you begin to regret that you even watched it . this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable , and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it 's full value . it 's supposed to be a psychological thriller , and mckenna is a decent actor , but it 's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have " norm " from " cheers " and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work , and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense . guys will love the violence , blood and guts scenes , and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots . girls will enjoy handsome sean 's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie , when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie . personally , i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ( ron livingston ) is only in the first one - third of the movie .

2645	synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library .  when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat .  comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it .  malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments .  the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film .  it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this .  melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before .  she drugs someone .  she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment .  and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend .  i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner .  john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) .  the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald .  at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes .  at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place .  in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches " f--k you , you b-----d " and throws a phone .  she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh .  malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either .  feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else .

2649	it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters .  his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie .  the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast .  it is filled with above-the-title stars .  the cast , for the most part , gives great performances .  john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve .  george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance .  one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration .  the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic .  these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick .  terrence malick is a cinematic legend .  he has often been called " the j . d . salinger of cinema . "  his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures .  after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years .  this film marks his return .  what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment .  the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as " i'm scared . "  the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted .  the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill .  a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured .  many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going .  the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault .  it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table .  this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed .  i'm not declaring that the film has no structure .  while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat .  the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking .  the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice .  this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video .  ultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them .  the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature .  while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish .  after seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again .

2652	some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen .  i finished mike figgis' " leaving las vegas " hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr .  alot of people refer to this film as " that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude " .   " leaving las vegas " is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore .  ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk .  his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor .  in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a " friend " of his to mooch some money off of .  he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid .  when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable .  after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says " i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again . "  now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben .  there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye .  it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy .  now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with .  once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death .  one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since " adventures in babysitting " ) named sera .  she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her .  they are both very lonely , self-destructive people .  they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another .  and it isn't even a sexual relationship .  they don't even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film .   " leaving las vegas " is not a film about plot .  with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn't too much of a story to it .  it is more a film about people and how they react to one another .  from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film .  the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter .  but don't go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into .  first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from " leaving las vegas " .  it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that's right ) .  secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don't see it .  however , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have .  
2653	first , a little summary . this reporter named torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military & government censoring him . nice message , government censorship and all that , but the way they did the movie was , well let me explain . this movie is beyond description . the idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by george romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution . the script is atrocious on its own , like it was written by a sixth grader . as for special effects , i understand that independent films have low budgets , and some gore effects looked acceptable , but if you want a scene with fire , here 's a tip : buy some nonflammable material , have an extinguisher ready , and get a fire going ! do n't digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a nintendo 64 game . the acting , well let 's put it this way . in my summer theater program , a cold reading of the script is , compared to this , the godfather . i wo n't even go into the inconsistencies . find them yourself . what disturbed me the most , though , was when everything was finished after shooting and editing , somebody might have said , " okay , this looks good . let 's release it . " it sends a chill down my spine to even think about it , to think somebody felt that this was good enough for dvd release . this is n't dvd quality . this is n't sci - fi channel quality . hell , this is n't even film school quality . if you were to submit this in for a project at a film school , you would get an f. no , not even an f , more like an f- . i would n't be surprised if he would try to get you expelled . i felt used after i saw this thing . blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now , and i 'd prefer not to think of what they 're doing with it . i have been the pawn of some elaborate , nefarious scheme at legalized theft , and it does n't feel good to think that i walked right into it , looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 days later only to find a film ed wood would watch and say afterwards , " i did n't much care for this . " this film is the single most terrible movie i have seen . i have not seen anything by ed wood , but i have confidence this is worse . if you are looking for serious cinema , so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache . if not , i still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night . however , if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then i recommend you check this out . you wo n't be disappointed .

2657	in my review of " the spy who shagged me , " i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore .  the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing .   " scream 3 " provides the latest proof of this rule .  in los angeles production has begun on " stab 3 : return to woodsboro , " the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) .  however , life soon starts imitating art , and " stab " cast members turn up stabbed .  smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in " stab 3 . " elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name .   .   .  until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice .  the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy .  he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with .  indeed , " scream 3 " tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original " scream . "  at the scene of each murder in " scream 3 , " the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer .  to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films .   ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) .  unlike its predecessors , " scream 3 " doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer .  the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is .  the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ?  the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ?  the driven young director ( scott foley ) ?  the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ?  the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random .  wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen .  the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious .  possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche .  i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first " scream " was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home .  at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas .   " scream 3 " also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles .  look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from " seinfeld " ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point .  all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- " scream " job search .  another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying " the blair witch project " 's web strategy .   " scream 3 " has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie .  the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the " latest 'stab 3' news . "  there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more " stab " scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) .  craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the " scream " series .  while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters .  there's a " halloween h2k " in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in " h20 , " and a " freddy vs . jason " has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were " killed off . "  there's bound to be a " scream 4 " someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes .  bottom line : they should have called this one " yawn . "

2661	it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
2662	there was a lot riding on this movie .  everyone even moderately interested in the " scream " series was dying to know how it would end .  what would be the " final act " ?  this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into " scream " while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves .  no need to worry ; " scream 3 " is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co .  so , how does the story go ?  as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems .  she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone .  but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off .  instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in " eye for an eye " ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him .  the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two .  not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) .  at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within " scream " has now become totally fictional .  nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene .  so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing .  sometimes both .  clever , indeed .  but , who goes next ?  no one knows .  three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the " scream " 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read .  still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly .  when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through " woodsboro , " written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of " scream 3 " ? ? ? s finest moments .  okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the " scream " fan .  no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said " dramatic element " ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with " scream " .  throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films .  granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore .  honestly , i like this approach .  it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven .  he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience .  some critics have noted that " scream 3 " seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s .  what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer .  it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying .  all in all , " scream 3 " does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films .  as a trilogy , " scream " was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat .  almost sad to see it go .  but then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and " scream 3 " does a fine job of providing closure to its characters .  for now , " scream " holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid .  not too shabby .

2667	stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder .  grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento .  boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento .  it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's .  based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer .  visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail .  at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints .  posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins .  a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives .  the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario .  it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration .  the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers .  but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years .  argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences .  effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent .  the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style .  proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers .  the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless .  asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating .  it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts .  thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest .  but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack .  active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts .  it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards .  it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together .  this is a long welcome reunion .  if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax .  but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career .   * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .  dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .

2682	 " virus " is a monster movie without a monster .  any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise .  sadly , " virus " does not deliver , on any level .  the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it .  sudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat .  cut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures .  see , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money .  at least , i * think * that's what they do .  along with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn't really explained .  so , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters .  the only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg .  yes , borg .  complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye .  apparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical .  so , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for " spare parts " .  blah , blah , blah .  i could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won't .  suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) .  everything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies .  for example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , " tetsuo-the iron man " .  and the plot is right out of " aliens " .  the funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie .  i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated " deep rising " .  but " virus " , as i mentioned earlier , doesn't even have a monster .  it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption .   " virus " is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it .  besides the lame " monster " , it's chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into .  for example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien !  now , i don't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it .  that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life .  finally , " virus " isn't scary .  the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary .  as it is , it's about as frightening as a box of cookies .  skip " virus " .  if it's a cool monster movie you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddy of this genre ) " aliens " .

2688	 " showgirls " is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating .  and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence .  but if " showgirls " is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking .   " showgirls " is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter .  director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's " basic instinct , " follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer .  it's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out .  there's the demanding producer .  the loyal friend .  the bitchy competitor .  lest i forget the scummy club owner .  of course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity .  unfortunately , " showgirls " doesn't satisfy in this department .  verhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic .  to make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history .  verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel .  you'll be the wiser for it .

2699	and i thought " stigmata " would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year .  turns out i was wrong , because while " stigmata " was merely boring and self-important , " end of days " is completely inept on all fronts .  it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess .  for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up .  for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and " batman & robin " doesn't count ) is no fun at all .   " end of days " is a major stinker .  the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 .  some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation .  if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed .  the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed .  in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy .  twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem .  now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil .  an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) .  recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her .  there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ?  casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with .  schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea .  arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions .  in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake .  harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger .  there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back .  none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task .  the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before .  this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him .  the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all .  as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident .  he acts like one would expect the devil to act .  the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain .  byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil .  byrne's speech about the bible being " overrated " actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the " 'tis not ! "  variety ) are feeble at best .  the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares .  kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour .  robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared .  in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do .  performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it .  this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous .  why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ?  because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out .  some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 !  if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone .  it's convoluted and silly at the same time .  the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see .   .   . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all .  why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ?  is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ?  how come he can't control jericho or christine ?  and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ?  a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained .  usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting .  there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in " end of days , " complete with the old " black cat hiding in a cabinet " bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there .  it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a " boo " will come .  their predictions will rarely be wrong .  the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense .  there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady .  it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else .  supposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly .  none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style .  most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , " wow , cool ! "   " end of days " is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch .  the devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight .  this doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in " end of days " goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) .  if violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb .  scenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why .  reasons ?  to hell with reasons !  let's just blow stuff up !  isn't it cool ?  nope , not by a long shot .  this film is thoroughly unwatchable .  it's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity .  perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here .   " end of days " might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy .  if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script .  if it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack .  as it stands , " end of days " is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .

2708	wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say .  this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie .  the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home .  he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law .  time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement .  by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards .  wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact .  who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ?  somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes !  still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff .  his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of " nothing counts as much as blood . "  equally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! )  sequence that is decidedly non-pc .  director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay .  the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics .  don't look for much glorified violence here .  despite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life .  the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) .  kevin costner is very good in the title role .  dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch .  he was tougher in a perfect world .  his foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday .  gaunt * and * gamely , he's a scene stealer who's seen too little .  other familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) .  both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid .  though the story and score should've tried " less is more , " all other credits are technical tops .  production designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must've been an enormous budget .  clearly no expense was spared .

2720	wow ! so much fun ! probably a bit much for normal american kids , and really it 's a stretch to call this a kid 's film , this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through . while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward , miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel - esquire moments . the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid / hero , with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein . and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike 's work , the layers of meaning and metaphor , particularly the anti - war / anti - revenge message of human folly , is pretty damn poignant . as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films , only instead of over the top torture and gore , he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk - lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi - faceted adventure . f'n rad , and one of miike 's best !
2721	it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as " raising arizona " and " the hudsucker proxy , " made their feature film debut with " blood simple , " a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas .  it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent " fargo , " but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; " blood simple " is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end .  the premise of " blood simple " is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m .  emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) .  things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme .  to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening .  every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the " big picture " and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person .  this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film .  the coens might have done well to title the film " fear and loathing in texas . "  some have labeled " blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else .  the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive .  that said , " blood simple " is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine .  the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film .  that said , " blood simple " is not exactly flawless .  for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder .  and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes .  the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film .   " blood simple " is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner .  i would firmly recommend it to all " coen-heads " as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller .  
2722	we all know the fate of " child's play , " which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell .  with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be " bride of chucky " - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about .  alas , the original " child's play " actually isn't that bad .  even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie .  it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , " i know what you did last summer " has recently gone .  the premise of " child's play " is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen .  the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday .  of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up .  like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy .  and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one .  the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that .  it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy .  it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments .  even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) ,  there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience .  the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with .  if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , " child's play " steers away from that .  and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look !  that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character .  if there's anything really wrong with " child's play , " it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem .  at almost 90 minutes , " child's play " features way too less to be a real classic of horror .  it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll .  if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which  isn't necessarily a bad thing .  as such , " child's play " is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .  
2723	a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
2724	a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
2725	everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene .  everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over .  and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance .  good !  that's what you're supposed to do !  oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning .  deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) .  major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry .  when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences .  it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) .  but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g .  pulp fiction ) .  pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny .  but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter .  the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory .  the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others .  joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) .  the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip .  they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task .  drew also has the famous " dueling banjos " competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged .  the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way .  everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone .  they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them .  ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men .  ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back .  the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body .  disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film .  while attempting to make a quick " paddle for it " , both canoes tip over .  drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found .  lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition .  this leaves ed and bobby .  ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow .  the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment " i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing " will have more meaning in the future .  deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) .  it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic .  it's definitely one of those " must see " movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade .

2732	ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really .  it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) .  in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians .  these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) .  this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well ,  you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) .  moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) .  in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) .  this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think .  after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) .  movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too " big " in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle .  maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) .  the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) .  in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's " kids in the hall " ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story .  unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well ,  you'll see .  the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .  one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka .  another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw .  and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint .  of course , the movie does have its share of silliness .  for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head .  in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become .  but what has he become ?  a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ?  doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre .  but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly .  so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films .  while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics .  but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left .  although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think .  i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign .  go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him .

2737	seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .  watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .  the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .  we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .  within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ?  he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) .  we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten .  sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .  but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too .  what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .  one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .  flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .  but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there's no rules about jumping too high . "   " predictable " doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .  and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition .  not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .  i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  it's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is .  the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human .  but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .  
2738	filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea .  doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker .  in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director .  but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same .  his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel .  consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives .  the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter .  in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal .  neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes .   ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . )  the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to .  the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles .  in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success .  although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories .  go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it .  as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme .   ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . )  at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .

2745	it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina .  the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain .  one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station .  the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away .  the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads .  at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act .  that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave .  deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) .  the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered .  over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over .  other plot elements are thrown in for good measure .  wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent .  braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate .  and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful .  the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners .  deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense .  the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting .  deceiver has the power to grab an audience .  unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing .  for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers .  it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .  of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic .  police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner .  but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details .  deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute .  the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours .  the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened .  moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks .  the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere .  there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models .  cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look .  some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks .  as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting .  roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be .  the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective .  both play their characters like familiar types .  penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .  some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors .  renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature .  rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition .  one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience .  plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters .  the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers .  occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .

2747	a melancholy , emotional film . 
2748	m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value .  it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses .  it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human .  the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols .  the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence .  except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed .  as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen .  m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue .  the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point .  the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way .  it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series .  but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance .  john woo ( " broken arrow " / " face/off " ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense .  the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast .  cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one .  their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing .  the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success .  we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville .  first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it .  he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain .  which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as  we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil .  the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role .  at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense .  soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains .  before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone .  he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust .  sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices .  we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel .  woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain .  it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense .  next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses .  hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team .  he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped .  hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds .  actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point .  in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road .  he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her .  the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) .  robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first " mission , " who is noted for doing " chinatown " -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way .  the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock .  ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first .  ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle .  ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass .  if i was only entertained by this . . . i  could have lived with it .  but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast .  in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into .  
2749	there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
2750	watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .  if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .  alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .  what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .  that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .  when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .  so why such a seemingly high rating ?  there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .  first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .  the sound and screen kicked ass .  nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .  also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .  i even liked the computer-generated settings .  i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .  also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .  william hurt isn't too bad either .  neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .  and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .  there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) .  it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .  those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .  that type of moviemaking is a lost art .  now for the bad news .  worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .  it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .   " you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line .  and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .  second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .  the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .  once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .  when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' "  then there's the tone of the movie .  the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .  then it could be an adventure movie .  they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .  still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .  just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who's the center of a family .  many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .  and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .  in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .  we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .  in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .  that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .  finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .  the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .  why ?  why bother saying what year this is .  just tell us it's the future .  i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .  setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .  then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .  this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .  one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .  the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .  this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .  but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .  still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards .  
2751	despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
2752	perhaps if the impostors didn't have so much going for it , it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment .  written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire .  sputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed .  the film's other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator's aide in bulworth .  the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub .  all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes .   ( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . )  with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter .  the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it .  the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship .  in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards .  the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer .  when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze .  at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms .  with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce .  the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having .  too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment .  the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground .  one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies .  surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing .  it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up .   " the show is over for this fella , " steve buscemi's character says towards the end .  the mystery is why they didn't all give up in the beginning .  there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast .  the impostors runs 1 : 42 .  it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .  
2753	the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
2754	a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days .

2757	too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
2758	at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . 
2759	the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
2760	jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .

2762	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
2763	it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
2764	bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
2765	while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
2766	my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration .  as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i've ever witnessed .  sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ?  then there's " caligula . "  this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man's rear , wine poured down a man who's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show " historical accuracy ; " c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time .  produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , " caligula " comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since " plan 9 from outer space " because underneath there's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining .  after all , it's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry .  no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it's about , it's about how it's about ( as the old cliche goes ) .  those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with " caligula , " and that's that it's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time .   " caligula " allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or  so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons .  the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage " what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , " depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) .  the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in " a clockwork orange " did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in " lawrence of arabia " ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne .  then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off .  the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity .  but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like .  oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ?  and that they killed people so disgustingly ?  and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not .  i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up .  and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time .  the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this .  but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark .  the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life .  not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus .  the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow .  there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's " adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? " ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : " he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . " )  the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous " adagio of spartacus and phrygia , " ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere .  the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated " x " ) .  john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , " i'm going to kill my agent , i'm going to kill my agent . . . "  and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making " caligula " about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying .  guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage .  throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying " look what i can get away with !  and if you don't like this , then you're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! "  uh huh .  there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good .  a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film .  but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film .  there's a film that came out in 1989 called " the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , " a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure .  that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving .  there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it's going to be offensive to many .  that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good .  and it's everything " caligula " might have been but , alas , wasn't .

2778	man , some of you people have got to chill . this movie was artistic genius . instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality , why ca n't you understand that it is a work of fiction ? a story . entertainment , for god 's sake ( no pun intended ) . it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics -- and they 're not doing to well . i 'm so impressed by the movie and bill paxton 's job at directing , that i 'm going to contact him personally to tell him . ya know , if you were n't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line , you might just enjoy the film . me and all of my friends did !
2779	there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director .  of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , " halloween , " but he also made 1980's " the fog , " and 1987's underrated , " prince of darkness . "  heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with " in the mouth of madness . "  but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , " memoirs of an invisible man . "  somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , " village of the damned , " to his uninspired 1996 sequel , " escape from l . a . " those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , " john carpenter's vampires . "  if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title .  it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , " vampires . "  the story is simple .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .  since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .  it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .  my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?  well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .   " john carpenter's vampires , " sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .  in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .  the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .  and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .  there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .  james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of " pseudo " -clever lines of dialogue .  daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .  and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in " twin peaks " ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .  there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , " john carpenter's vamires , " which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .  he has said that he turned down directing , " halloween : h20 , " because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .  and yet , when asked about a " vampires " sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .  i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .  
2780	not that i tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed , but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath , and what i get is one bloody scene ( the eyeball ) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping , and spinning in a desk chair , i end up thinking " well that 's 43 minutes of my life gone forever . " i would n't considers this or flower of flesh and blood " movies " so much as an exercise of will ; to see if you can sit through them . flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch . the devil 's experiment did not . it was at best , stupid , and at worst ... well ... really stupid . perhaps my expectation were too high . i put the dvd thinking " oh man , this is gon na be sick . " after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times , i was watching it in fast forward . two kinds of people would be interested in this film . 1 ) people who seek out f'd up films just to see how f'd up it really is , or 2 ) horror completest . i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason , but even if i fell into the category of the former , this film would n't float my boat . as a matter of fact , i could imagine this film increasing one 's blood lust ... as in " would you just kill the b*tch already ! ! " so in conclusion , the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes . if you want carnage that traditional horror does n't provide , get traces of death . sure , that sucks too , but at least you 'll get the blood and guts you expect . the only reason i can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they 're supposed to . no artistic merit that i can comprehend , no reason for it 's notoriety , no nothing . just a lame attempt to be shocking .
2781	every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections .  such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life .  despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film .  you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .  will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it .  he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer .  he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk .  after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor .  after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems .  in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .  the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .  even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .  alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it .  the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .  is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?  of course .  is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ?  usually , yes .  but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ?  not very likely .  come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school  girls .  will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition .  the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary .  all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways .  damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary .  which leads me to the really good part of the review .  the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .  i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .  from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent .  robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .  the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting .  the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen .  when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about .  watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about .  gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score .  i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? .  despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .  
2782	painfully padded . 
2783	i am a steven seagal fan .  i only say this now because " mufti splenetik " isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things .  any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on .  seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine .  not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his " my hands are sharp , nimble knives " thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull .  in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest .  he's also put on quite a lot of weight .  small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ?   ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) .  as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past .  while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole .  it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that " glimmer man " thing .  an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons .  the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) .  it's the other changes that disappoint .  for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's " in living colour . "  wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his " are you crazy " part of the dialogue with wasted zest .  as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching .  a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble .  he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies .  again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual .  heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film .  is that a lot to ask of the seague ?  too much .  seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone .  not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think .  no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows .  that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else .  we trusted him .  we got to know him .  now , betrayal .  i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again .  i'll try , but it won't be easy .  if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out .  it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences .  after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan .  everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .

2786	if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings .  the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does .  unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film .  nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) .  i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan .  well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) .  the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session .  kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl .  he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) .  he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury .  he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife .  after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer .  he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god .  he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck .  his life seems to be on the rise .  and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline .  he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment .  mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted .  meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people .  he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane .  all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .  after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends .  a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father .  is it all just a big nightmare ?  or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ?  the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect .  is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?  if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early .  i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got .  i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got .  but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) .  the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you .  films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less .  we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .  the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all .  if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .  as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .  the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .  and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .  it was at this point that i felt cheated .  taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film .  everything occurs from his perspective .  he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .  but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .  i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .  perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .  it earned its r rating for a reason .  there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .  this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything .  it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .  however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those .  i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .  the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .  the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann .  portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .  this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .  she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .  something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .  the story actually has something to say about humanity .  in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .  he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .  then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .  this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .  what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .  these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .  when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .  the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect .  heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .  probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .  he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance .  i have never seen him more believable to date .  al pacino is of course the scene stealer .  his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .  he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) .  jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .  judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past .  connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .  one familiar face with a twist was " coach " star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance .  the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .  at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .  for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .  the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .  director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .  i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .  but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .  personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .

2810	imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes .  so far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere .  it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness .  it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption .  the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing .  kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job .  when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department .  minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops .  jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j .  t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner .  it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor .  jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight .  disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here .  there , trouble arises .  and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head .  there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam .  it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff .  kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses .  so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect .  suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one .  not many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them .  as an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes .  although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with .  faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is .  what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow .  mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair .  contrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance .  after breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety .  the villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective .  the baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder .  the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies .  worth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for .  alfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears .  breakdown yields exactly that .  it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero .  despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown .

2816	warning : spoilers are included in this review . . .  but it doesn't really make much of a difference .  deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .  remember when dante's peak came out in february ?  a few months later , volcano was released .  the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .  the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .  well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .  this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .  of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak .  but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .  apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me .  to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .  volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .  deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .  the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .  deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .  a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .  among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .  leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .  he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .  a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .  we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .  she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .  she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .  after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .  luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain " ellie " that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .  that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) .  before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .  they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .  beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .  naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .  and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .  they announce a plan called " ark , " which is their only hope for survival .  a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .  these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race .  after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .  the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .  jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .  the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .  it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .  now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .  the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !  by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work .  director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show " er . "  her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .  well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .  suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .  much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .  throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .  it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .  of course , leder isn't all to blame for it .  screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .  what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .  chock full of cheesy one liners ( " you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! " )  and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .  only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .  and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .  to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .  that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .  scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .  but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .  the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable .  what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .  give me a break , will ya ?  and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .  well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .  the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .  cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .  in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .  just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .  one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors .  leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .  this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .  but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .  leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .  one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .  this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space .  this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .  on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .  the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .  then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional .  it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into " feeling " for the characters , but it didn't work for me .  but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .  t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's " the naked truth " ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .  her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her .  robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .  elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !  you are too talented for this stuff ) .  vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .  maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .  morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .  leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .  a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .  eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .  crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's " star trek : the next generation . "  seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .  overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .  deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .  this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .  luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .  it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much .  costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .  well , it's not .  when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .  
2817	this movie scared the crap out of me ! i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary . i screamed out loud two or three times during the show . film - making - wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography . the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful . i read somewhere that it 's some weird husband and wife team that made it . for some reason that makes this even stranger for me .   if you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you ! very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls !

2820	amy heckerling 's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930 's gangster films made in the warner brothers ' tradition . michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 . keaton 's mother ( maureen stapleton ) has continuing health problems , so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle . meanwhile , the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks . joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin , yeah that 's right , vermin ! griffin dunne is keaton 's younger brother turned district attorney , glynnis o'connor his wife , and marilu henner plays keaton 's moll . the film looks notoriously cheap , making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film . the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour . due to the combination of dialog and gags , the film holds its own for the first half , but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half . keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression . stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious , not funny . piscopo does the " once " bit one time too many . several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito , dom deluise , ray walston as a street vendor , alan hale , jr. as a desk sergeant , and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady . the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers . the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film . i think heckerling should have known better , since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties ' actual 1939 release date . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
2821	an indian runner was more than a courier .  he * became * the message he was carrying .  what danger is a bear , to a message ?  i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth .  but all that has changed now .  the guy has grown up .  and that's not all .  it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication .  one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper .  but , no .  this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .  penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash .  the focus of the story is two brothers .  david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer .  viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve .  the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line .  it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared .  the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere .  it isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them .  life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems .  this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face .  in fact , i'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing .  there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw .  i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well .  the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all .  in my opinion , it is worth full-price admission .

2831	ladies and gentlemen , payback is the most expensive episode of " the equalizer " i've ever seen .  gibson plays porter , a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger , in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist .  as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter's back , porter miraculously springs back to life .  he makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot .   ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000 haul . )  in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory " operation " ) .  helgeland's film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm .  the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone .  payback should have been called playback : it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence .   ( mel : " i want my money . "  anonymous villain : " no . "  mel shoots gun .  anonymous villain dies .  mel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello ) .  second verse , same as the first . )  it's not porter's single-mindedness that robs the film of snap , crackle , and pop ; as a character who has already " died " once , he has nothing to lose and so much to gain .  the movie lacks danger .  the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep .  payback has a gritty , metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months .   ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . )  to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves .  perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman's point blank ) .  the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither .  
2832	phew , what a mess !  for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on .  she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him .  is one of jerry's conjectures correct ?   * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ?  is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ?  is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ?  no , no , and no .  as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background .   ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . )  the * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip .  mel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating .   ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? )  even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair .  there's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container .   ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . )  other hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion .   ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . )  let's see , other pleasures include . . .  a brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall .  oh , pretty woman !  getting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story .  the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable .  more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts .  and here i thought it was wabbit season .  good god , who rewrites these movies ?  and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ?

2838	the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic .  finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius .  combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of " kramer vs .  kramer " ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment .  in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ?  -- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere .  over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life .  he's screwed up things pretty well ( " i had a wife and daughter .  now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads .  a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them .  the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends .  one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up .  to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine .  jack is in even worse shape than harry .  he's dying of cancer with only a year to live .  things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him .  instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes .  this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before .  through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to .  it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about .  the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario .  by the time they show you , it doesn't matter .  the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe .  these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither .  rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember .  a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform .  it's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course .  on the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen .  the three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs .  newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style .  he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out .  hackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle .  sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional .  the actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it's dug for itself .  james garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like " i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off . "  the best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make .  the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen  the film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless .  the only reason for watching is the actors .  it reminds me of disaster movies such as " towering inferno " where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film's problems .  in a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better .  of course , we don't live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie .

2847	susan granger's review of " hearts in atlantis " ( castle rock/warner bros . )  timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming-of-age nostalgia of " stand by me " with the mystical power of " the green mile . "  based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self-centered mother ( hope davis ) .  he's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card .  knowing he's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers .  the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive .  the only explanation is that he's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now .  the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " hearts in atlantis " is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis .

2871	robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people .  in " the natural " ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be " the best there ever was , " but still acted like a humble farm boy .  in " butch cassidy and the sundance kid " ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer .  even in " indecent proposal " ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love .  in his latest film , " the horse whisperer , " based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character .  redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up .  despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase " horse whisperer " to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life .  booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident .  the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg .  annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker .  at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work .  instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) .  in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically .  the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country .  in " the horse whisperer , " country is clearly the victor .  the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people .  redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed " a river runs through it " six years ago .  in many ways , " the horse whisperer " comes from the same poetic vein as " river , " and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains .  but then , that would ruin the magic .  much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land .  to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( " natural born killers , " " platoon " ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .  in terms of the story itself , " the horse whisperer " gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's " a brief encounter " ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's " the bridges of madison county " ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted " bridges " ) .  although " the horse whisperer " has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story .  it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is .  in " the horse whisperer , " the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill .  he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him .  he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man .  there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character .  it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap .  as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him .  it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness .  after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it .  the best scenes in " the horse whisperer " tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse .  although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing .  these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true .  at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more .  nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film .  there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together .  although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make " the horse whisperer " worth the price of admission .  
2872	back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman .  that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . .  last action hero .  but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and " got lost . "  if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe .  you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film .  at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in .  to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not .  after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's " stream " of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting .  they encounter another ship .  they board it .  alien spiders attack them .  they return to their ship .  the other one explodes .  they land on a deserted planet .  and so on .  an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on .  the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that .  for a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy .  in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . .  digital effects .  but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny's pet .  entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game .  apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ?  but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious .  you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy .  new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount .  i don't think so .  in a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic's 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ?  
2873	an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
2874	it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece .  certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's .  the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war .   " apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history .  the plot is fairly simple .  captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty .  his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " .  along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies .  willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives .  willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending .  the movie is visually breathtaking .  the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate .  the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening .  the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie .  the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character .  the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission .  it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie .  the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne .  the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz .  coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd .  the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution .  the problems come when the film slows down .  one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess .  the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film .  the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound .  the film slows down to a drag .  sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received .  brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic .  the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief .  sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told .  the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations .  granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion .  brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ?  there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene .  there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending .  the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple .  his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film .  yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done .  the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good .  it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war .  but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for .  there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .

2883	the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
2884	these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
2885	what is freedom ?  how does one determine who is free ?  in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now .  yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations .  that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama " amistad " is about .  through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard " la amistad " .  on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew .  however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder .  in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away .  the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back .  the two spaniards who own " la amistad " want the slaves for themselves .  the american ship that found the slaves also wants them .  in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free .  they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them .  through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  the film itself is a visual wonder .  spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well .  at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical .  however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag .  the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified .  the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist .  but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning .  it is this emotional force that carries the film .  mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar .  the movie , however , belongs to hounsou .  his emotional intensity is brilliant .  spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating .  the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard .  but that doesn't matter .  the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance .  kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque .  a good job all around .  
2886	let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal .  so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal .  i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times .  under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix .  this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet .  the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age .  in other words , the sound sucked .  as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film .  i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together .  there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review .  which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing .  my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .  it is nothing short of stunning visually .  sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good .  the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked .  keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax .  it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster .  now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network .  the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed .  the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose .  that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .  they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie .  reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .  newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters .  the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular .  this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts .  this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film .  when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful .  as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film .  acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either .  keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances .  although to his credit , it is one of his better performances .  laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film .  more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama .  joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had .  carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role .  it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks .  you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film .  it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences .  i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times .  in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird .  it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie .  so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about .  thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability .  my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending .  the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before .  the ending itself was just plain strange .  the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch .  while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening .  
2887	feels untidily honest . 
2888	deep rising is one of " those " movies .  the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us .  it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors .  heh !  them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em .  of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra " oumph " to get people in theaters .  that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing .  confused ?  let me explain :  despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie .  luckily , it's a very good b movie .  the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter .  therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre .  of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive .  we just don't know when or how horrible it will be .  i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high .  imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times .  a funny b movie ?  well , that's new .  these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh .   ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . )  and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen .  hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies .  cool .  familiar faces .  so far so good .  our man treat is the hero , he'll live .  wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim .  we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out .  famke is the babe , 'nuff said .  there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy .   ( ah !  comic relief .  how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let  him live . )  after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home .  i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew .   ( please kill me . )  suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went " ewwww " about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing .  i'm a man , we nottice these things .  all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but  bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you .  the acting is decent , the effects top rate .  how to best describe it ?  put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming " don't go there , he's behind you " and you end up with deep rising .  for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .  
2889	certain dvd 's possess me until i just have to go out and buy it . this was one of those movies . like many on here , i remember seeing it as a child and loved it . i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut , so i was intrigued to see what they might be . i will agree that the " portabellow road " sequence is now a tad long ( as is the soccer game ) but other than that , i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place . perhaps disney should have had the original version ( which is the restored version ) on one side with the restored version on the flip side , then people could choose what they wanted to view . all in all , it 's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories .
2890	the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
2891	i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language . ( not ' dialect ' as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as . as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other . ) but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie . being a canadian , of cebuano parents , i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film . i was further excited to hear that it was n't another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies . but alas , i was short - changed . panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano . montano of course plays the hero of the movie . and when i say ' hero ' i mean in the most stereotypical of manners ; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol - anons to victory against the japanese . his character has no depth or complexity . he just fits the hero mold . the rest of the characters are one dimensional ; they all fit their cookie cutter roles . i 'm all for slow - moving / meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving . it did n't really meditate on anything . just because a movie is historically - themed , a drama and slow - moving does n't make it a well - made film . particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony . his performance was embarrassing . if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through . he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc . but really , this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals . to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences , even if it meant sacrificing quality . obviously he did n't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience - attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door . i 'm afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie . if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i 'd get an answer like , " visayans do n't make good movies . did n't you see panaghoy sa suba ? " of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see . an example of movies that are meditative , not just slow moving , are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch 's the straight story . i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non - tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie . these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called ' pure cinema ' . images without words are used to convey the story . but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie . and they do it very well . panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood . and what 's with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ? ? ?
2892	i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater ( where i used to attend " kiddie matinée"s almost every saturday ) in dayton , ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it . it simply amazed me and my friends . i do wish there were some way i could see it again ! i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail . i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more . how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding . the fish is actually in the cat 's mouth at one point , if i remember correctly ! if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful !
2893	in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters  damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
2894	béart and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
2895	a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
2896	it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
2897	unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
2898	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
2899	try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
2900	catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up .  she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life .  as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties .  a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls .  just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia .  the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state .  in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . .  a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours !  initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix .  while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm .  the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's " losing my religion " ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory .  despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery .  all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe .  the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room .  if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) .  the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) .  in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . -  the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him .  the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him .  detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both .  besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling .  a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting .  one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device .  as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking .  as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done .  although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together .  unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .  
2901	nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
2902	[ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
2903	it is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of aids . the projected toll is greatest in sub - saharan africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . christophe honoré describes one of the most moving in close to leo , a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common -- the effect of a diagnosis of hiv on a loving close - knit family . when twenty one - year old leo ( pierre mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , tristan ( rodolphe pauley ) and pierrot ( jeremie lippmann ) that he has aids , the family is devastated . out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12-year old marcel ( yannis lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . when leo goes to paris for treatment , he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth . leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting . when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion .   although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by lespert and mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . seeing events unfold from the young boy 's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the quebecois film leolo and truffaut 's the 400 blows . unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids , close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real .
2904	 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
2905	more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
2906	it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
2907	there 's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  " i was quite a hand with a slingshot , " " the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy " ( full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face ) , " go and sit with the concubines . " and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan " whatever you say . " he even tries the old " my kingdom does n't understand me " routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point . so it 's probably a tribute to henry king 's direction that the film is n't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide . maybe it 's the censor - baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale 's husband and gets away with it !  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne 's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum . this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope , abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands , and the film does n't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty . it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law , where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives . unlike king david , which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul , david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close - up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan 's death , gregory peck 's performance grows in stature as david shrinks . susan hayward is pure hollywood pro , raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet ( why be naturalistic when you 've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake ? ) and kieron moore 's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you ca n't exactly blame david for putting him in harm 's way , but despite threatening to soft peddle the film does n't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death . with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s biblical epics . fox 's new dvd is a good transfer , including an incredibly hokey ' candid ' behind - the - scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film 's sole battle scene .
2908	 . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
2909	it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
2910	a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
2911	given the chance to write , direct and star in my own movie , i would probably choose something about robot women with guns . anthony hopkins , however , decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen . " slipstream " is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say ' what 's going on ? ' . this is a movie where , in one scene , a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left . this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls . this is a movie where a man starts talking about " invasion of the bodysnatchers " only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself ( and then disappear into thin air ) .   this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so , as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all . i must , however , commend mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie ( some of whom portray multiple characters ) . all of those involved throw themselves into their roles , even if they probably have no idea what they 're actually doing . my favourite here was christian slater 's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the american national anthem .   anthony hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that 's possibly the best way to sum up " slipstream " . it 's a joke on the audience . you 'll watch it from beginning to end , trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come , only to discover that the answer never actually does . what the punchline to this particular joke is , only anthony hopkins will ever know . i mentioned david lynch earlier and i 'm a big fan of that particular director . i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of " twin peaks " , " blue velvet " and " lost highway " . however , " slipstream " is n't as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques ( although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in " slipstream " ) . it 's far too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out , it 's the movie version of alzheimer 's disease . no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it . unfortunately for the rest of us , " slipstream " quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to hopkins ' involvement . watch at your own risk .
2912	[davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
2913	it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
2914	the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
2915	every sunday , a trio of buds get together at a nyc diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before . sometimes they 're joined by a newlywed ex - comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle . they 're unabashed horn dogs / corn dogs and mia , who witnesses them on the prowl , decides that they need to be taught a lesson , dammit . ergo , she 'll date and dump - why not ? all three of them !   gasp . what a wild idea . what a radical , naughty gal . women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to . as much as men do , even !   there is one solitary laughable element in " whipped " - namely the fact that not once , during the amigo 's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash , do the other customers in the diner turn around and say , " dude , we 're trying to eat here . " indeed , a heh - heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages . a big fat kermit the frog " sheesh " to that . it 's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting , a smart , cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop - out ending . p.s. - 30 " whip - oosh " sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase " you go , girl " . it was tired in 2000 , and it 's tired now . save your time and watch some " sex and the city " reruns ...
2916	there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story .  but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought .  for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction .  our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be .  brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a " wiseguy " .  regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well .  his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing .  true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins .  the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily .  the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors .  the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino .  more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively .  donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious .  lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music .  inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us .  it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's .  just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface .  in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations .  donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them .   ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a " damn you mcbain ! "  i hear from springfield way ? )  so the movie is cliched .  big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ?  well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .  donnie brasco fails on both counts .  the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades .  admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm .  depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style .  the consequences are painful to watch .  its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent .  perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .  maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .  if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes .  depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats .  who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?  but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all .  
2917	now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
2918	confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
2919	a long-winded , predictable scenario .

2921	an inuit masterpiece that will give you goosebumps as its uncanny tale of love , communal discord , and justice unfolds . 
2922	i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
2923	parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
2924	i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release .  michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof .  the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) .  greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes .  these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences .  it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .  if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words .  but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest .  it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .  for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk .  wish me luck .  first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .  while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .  he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .  another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .  they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there .  it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis .  but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ?  enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience .  it's stupid , pointless and repetitive .  i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone .  action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .  and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .  don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs .  it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .  the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .  it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure .  coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .  especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .  things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat .  if that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .  their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .  wait , maybe the only big laughs . . .  i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk .  i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that .  i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate .  but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck .  
2925	this movie had it all , action , comedy , heroics , and best of all some of the finest actors . gunga din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies . excellent picture , i have it in my collection .
2926	it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
2927	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .

2930	you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
2931	in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg .  eight years later , moore and goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog .  forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games .  good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey .  along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists .  every so often , like at the end of a video game " level " or " stage , " the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns .  just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what , all of red's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red .  i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance .  all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting .  once you've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you've seen it every time .  as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work .  while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence .  i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog .  regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ?  
2932	the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .

2935	mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect .  a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .  however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .  jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .  this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show .  not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .  there are only two scenes of him cooking .  for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .  it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?  a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .  although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm ,  shades of broadcast news ? ? ?  anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape .  here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ?  oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense .  as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .  this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .  in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language .  however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases .  strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .  whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films .  the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .  but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .  look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ?  watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .  the action is a mixed bag here .  there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films .  it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan .  the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .  the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .  once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .  but to slo-mo jackie running ?  either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down .  if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy .  however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .  
2936	according to imdb , as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this " thing " does n't have a director . well , that would surely explain a lot ! just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra - thin storyline about devil - worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium . " hardgore " is a prime example of totally demented 70 's smut , as it 's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration . horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70 's and pornography as well , so why not combine the two ? here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who 's committed to a mental asylum , and from the first night already , she 's drawn into a network of drugs , psychedelic orgies , rape , torture and dildo - action . really , a lot of dildo - action . the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her , but she has her throat slit even the same night . the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated , going from laughably un - scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks . the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish , but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm - firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ? leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body , but most of her co - stars ( male & female ) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls .

2950	even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .  down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .  like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .  then comes the transparent plotline .  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .  finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .  first they're singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .  the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .  it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .  the jokes are right out of " mchale's navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .  there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! "  i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . "  i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .  my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will .  the blame can't really be placed on the stars , though .  kelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with .  his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis .  grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about .  same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous .  as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship .  my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster .  judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me .  the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson .  i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! "  without ever seeing it ) didn't like this .

2955	the happy bastard's 30-second review  notting hill  a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $15 million asking price for movies .  one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly .  sure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press .  it's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks .  roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl .  in short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike .  one tee-shirt really says it all about him .  in an attempt to turn on a woman , he shows the front of the shirt , which says : " you are the most beautiful woman in the world . "  on the back ?   " fancy a f * * k ? "  
2956	a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle " heaven can wait " ( which in turn was a remake of " here comes mr . jordan " ) , " down to earth " tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , " lethal weapon iv " ) , a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlem's apollo theater .  when he's taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy , " best in show " ) , his only recourse is to return in another body .  he chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states .  of course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance's bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , " jerry maguire " ) , a tad tricky .  the original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k .  to turn beatty's vehicle as a football player into rock's vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor .  as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of " american pie " and costars of " chuck & buck " ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour .  initial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals .  production values are shoddy .  most serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate .  this problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen .  rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington's plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( 'bullet in the head ?  you got a bed ! ' ) , but he's uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast .  regina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis .  also good is frankie faison ( " hannibal " ) as whitney , lance's compassionate manager - the only human who's made privy to lance's body body switch .  chaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven's ambassadors .  another " best in show " alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington's cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv's " ally mcbeal , " " sweet november " ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband's lawyer .  mark addy ( " the full monty " ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington's fake english butler .  stealing the show in every scene she's in is wanda sykes ( " the chris rock show " ) as wellington's disgruntled maid .   " down to earth " is for chris rock fans only .  all others should go rent " heaven can wait " or truly be brought down to earth .

2989	synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .  everyone else around him has similar symptoms .  lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .  his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .  and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .  the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .  when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .  will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?  opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone .  likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .  sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .  the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .  american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .  the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .  the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .  if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .  
2990	my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) .  i didn't see the first film until much later .  so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it .  watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever .  you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before .  this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story .  plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a " hook " for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless .  and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ?  don't get me wrong though . . .  it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics .  most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is .  horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it .  a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video .  it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set .  the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) .  the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix .  also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography .  other extras include the " jump to a nightmare " feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer .  some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that .  the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular .  the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago .  i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out .  everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all .  most of the time you'll forget he's even there .  everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible .  the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series .  also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . .  however you can only access one easily .  the other is hidden in what's called " the labyrinth " , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created .  basically , it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film .  finding it though is both a chore and a bore .

2995	plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music .  one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) .  once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce .  at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star .  that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants .  this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers .  critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through .  in fact , this isn't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet .  i guess that i was expecting the former going in .  the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant .  but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience .  chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) .  well , i personally don't care for those films , and didn't really get into the whole " show " atmosphere of this movie either .  i guess i might've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn't care enough about the characters to delve into the " so the butterfly represents his freedom ? "  side of things .  all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled .  what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ?  what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ?   ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? )  what ever happened to the lawsuit ?  and more . . .  all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .  if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .  i didn't get it .  the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either .  then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .  some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added " atmosphere " of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience .  but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied .  i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers .  i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .  note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single " mainstream " critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .  but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the " official " critics , while i , a regular " joblo " in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about .  this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews .  where's joblo coming from ?  moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 )

2998	recap : the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother - in - law - to - be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him . unfortunately its a waitress from the bar , and not his fiancée . and suddenly she turns up everywhere ... the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent - in - laws dinner . and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex - boyfriend had him followed and photographed . it is not only about saving his wedding ... it is about survival . comments : actually much better than expected . not the sweet romantic comedy i expected , but something much funnier , something with a little edge . this movie was n't afraid to take the jokes a little further . and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy , especially when his character is half - panicked and deep in trouble , as he is here . and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair . and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex . so , more emphasis on comedy than romance , and the end result was good . i enjoyed it very much . 7/10
2999	other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
3000	very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
3001	a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
3002	the engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion . 
3003	daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
3004	filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it .

3006	it brings to mind the writings of stephen king and the remembered childhoods filled with terror from stories like it - as the exact opposite . there is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who are still friends 20 years up the line - remember or seem to suffer from . up the line all is described as friendly jostling , maybe periodically described as " picking on " one or more of them , but all is forgiven . there is no * angst * embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people having grown up to be basically the same persons . more mature , but basically still the same people , and the same power structures . totally amazing ! not just for the fact that people can in fact grow up relatively unharmed by social conventions - but also that friendships can in fact last . in this respect this movie is a tiny pearl - as one assumes this has been the intent of the film : a portrait of unforced emotions binding people together . which , when seen in opposition to films of later years portraying the dark sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in bowling for combine is what easily springs to mind , but since mid 80'ies along with the growing adoration of children and childhood ( accompanied by 1000s of commercials , animations and series directed straight at children ) several movies and documentaries have had success with portraying the dark sides of growing up - the abuse , the loneliness , the push to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted minds . and here comes a film , that says : it is possible to have a happy childhood , look'a'here ! thank you for that . or the counterweight illusion ... 8/10
3007	nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
3008	this cecil b. demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur 's finest performance , as a hysterical , eccentric , incurably amoral , but devotedly doting calamity jane . she really pulled it off ! gary cooper is at his most taciturn , but manages some occasional pithy sayings : ' the plains are big , but trails cross ... sometimes . ' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches . all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james . even abraham lincoln opens the story in person ( or at least , demille would have us believe so ) . there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety , this is a ' stomp 'em in the face ' tale for the masses . a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name ' the military industrial complex ' . it is n't just a story about gun - runners , but about arming anyone for money , and doing so from the heart of washington . but let 's not get into politics , let 's leave that to demille , who can be guaranteed to be superficial . the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil , who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography , ' bad boy of music ' . antheil seems to have originated ' the big sound ' adopted by all subsequent westerns , whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky , celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies . that is why it does not sound at all unusual , because we have heard it a thousand times . but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore , and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then , corny as it may be , but doubtless appropriate . it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian . gabby hayes is in there somewhere , but you miss him in the crowd . gary cooper overtops them all , looming large , - but when did he ever loom small ?
3009	despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
3010	if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
3011	i love movies .  i really do .  every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display .  even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value .  then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money .  disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk .  christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship .  along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . '  'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does .  many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment .  filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy .  christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now .  jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless .  his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives .  darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited .  hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . '  way to go liz !  for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . '  before finally giving up and switching off .  another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . '  unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . '  instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick .  although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud .  a real dud .  citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester .  even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk .  it's a nice special effect , though .  another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves .  or rather , the lack of them .  my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer .  now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .  but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . '  it's insulting .  there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued .  either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes .  yes , men at work .  yowza !  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more .  there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease .  thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .  
3012	there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
3013	this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .

3016	there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do .  i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda .  something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob .  deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test .  sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse  me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion .  there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold .  as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients .  a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits .  and up go the lights .  it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream .  here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic .  writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously .  deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes .  case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda .  in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive .  he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable .  in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive .  he looks at another character . . . and  winks .  make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing .  it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun .  i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies .  you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing .  just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point .  
3017	by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny .

3019	battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close .  in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years .  based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information .  it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes .  ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind .  when were we conquered ?  the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . .  keep reading ) .  also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ?  how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ?  humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado .  they grunt and groan and babble about monsters .  so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ?  none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) .  this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film .  one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it .  the " monster " turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course .  he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them .  so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ?  anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit .  the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something .  so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ?  and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ?  one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos .  so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ?  please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood .  why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ?  shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ?  the psychlos refer to humans as " man animals " but yet dogs are still " dogs " .  why aren't they " dog animals " ?  the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ?  why do i even care at this point ?  i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) .  but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ?  and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ?  he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter .  now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta .  all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee .  also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world .  ooooo , scary villain .  as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better .  you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth .  i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . .  i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . .  and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids .  by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film .  folks , save your cash . .  don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it .  you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . .  we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) .  unless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie .  that , and a headache .  [editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology .  i'm not sure why . . .  something just made me feel compelled make the choice . ]  
3020	this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film .

3031	i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work . finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on lifetime movie channel . jim larson 's comments about it being a " sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths " were dead on . writers probably should n't get a bonus , everyone else sro for making the movie . anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it . natasha 's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric , to say nothing of her beauty , that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for . god bless her , her family and future endeavors . this movie does n't seem to available in dvd or video yet , but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too .
3032	i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
3033	after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie , i knew what was supposed to happen . i had high expectations of the movie , because of the rating . the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie . i have a couple main points for not liking this movie . * * * * * * * * * * spoilers * * * * * * * * * * 1 . the casting . jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence 's character . also , i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy . i pictured wendy much differently . i can see why they picked jack nicholson though , the grin , the pointy eyebrows , but he 's not supposed to really look ' evil ' . he 's supposed to look normal , and he turns evil . also , they make one of the worst movie couples . danny was alright , he needed more life though . he acted way to droney . 2 . the screenplay . they cut out so many things that were in the book , and added things . some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted , changed , or handled wrongly . some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing ( the hedge animals , the roque mallet , the elevator ) were not in the movie , and it was 2 and half hours ! ! i was extremely irritated . 3 . the ending . the ending was changed completly , halorann died , jack froze to death , wendy never got hurt ... the overlook did n't blow up . the ending was so cool in the book , and the movie messed it up so horribly , i was apalled . hallorann was never supposed to die , but jack killed him with an ax . if they wanted to kill him , at least have jack use a roque mallet . you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie . there are other things that i did n't like about the movie , but there are things that were all right . the camera angels were cool , the blood coming out of the elevator ( did n't happen in the book ) was cool , but maybe i was too irritated that the movie did n't go with the book , to try to be scared at all . i reccomend reading the book , before you see this movie . i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more . i would never have done that , i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day . i ca n't wait to see the 6 hour version , at least it has the hedge animals . rating : 2/10
3034	the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .

3036	ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
3037	a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
3038	i saw this on tv so long ago that i ca n't remember when it was , but it still stands out as one of the scariest , most unnerving films i 've ever seen . there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame , not quite clearly visible , so that you feel ( like the solicitor hero ) , unsure whether its just imagination or not . it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching . " production values " be hanged , good films are about a director 's ability to create atmosphere using film , actors , locations / sets , music , attention to detail , and ... imagination . a real gem .

3043	synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) .  farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle .  grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) .  review : one memorable aspect of disney's " aladdin " was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents .   " shrek " does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass .  all the same , " shrek " does represent murphy's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines .  for instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , " now i'm a flying talking donkey ! "  and despite its many contributors , the script for " shrek " is full of such comic gems .  myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) .   " shrek " takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain .  things do go somewhat astray during the film's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie's greatest strength .  but even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology .

3059	two years ago , on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie " sue " in the panorama program , with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part . it 's a film about loneliness and sex , and how the one thing is compensated by the other . in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue , " extension du domaine de la lutte " , which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem . but unfortunately we ca n't sympathize with " our hero " ( how he is called by the story - teller ) , because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself . own fault , i 'm sorry . i ca n't understand him . not enough , the writer / director / actor want us admitting to him , that it 's not his destroyed self - consciousness or the passivity of his personality , what brought him so far , but the rotten society and its image of sexuality . yes , there are some deeper insights about gender relations , but we wo n't follow him so far ... and the point is , that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate , having no sex . who did n't notice yet , it 's a quite depressing film ... in the beginning , there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation . at the bed store the " hero " speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed . perhaps it 's too broad getting up the stairs , you have to stay at home half a day ... this is a satire about a character , who does n't know taking the life and heart in hands , doing something ... the movie doesn`t follow this path , but handles his characters with helplessness . nobody believes , that " our hero " is able to instigate tisserand for a murder . too dull , too kind , too - passive ( not to mention tisserand 's complex ; he has an inhibition , but he could n't be , of course , a murderer of women ! ) . to finish : there are women and the world , it 's not a device of a modern sexualized society . help you as you can , but do n't follow the messages and the " wisdom " of this movie , which announces bankruptcy to human relationships , without seizing the real conflicts within .

3065	the spy game is up .  you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that .  when did banality and pandering become okay ?  just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ?  charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages .  charlie's angels is dumb .  just plain dumb .  as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie .  they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion .  and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party .  the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company .  of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe .  the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair .  the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp .  the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother .  charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .  nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions .  it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one .  diaz is a knucklehead .  barrymore is the " dangerous one , " mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role .  liu is just . . .  lucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit .  the list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing .  the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan's movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv's friends .  it's a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year's favorite , go .  then again , what can you expect from a director known solely as " mcg . "  there is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players .  note to hollywood : next time , let's leave the tv shows on the tv .  
3066	trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease . 
3067	the yet-to-be-released krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware .  this movie can't make up its mind .  is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ?  or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ?  either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort .  the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses .  now it's time to show what he's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it .  with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald's .  but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it .  with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe .  despite the professor's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf's main assistant .  hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books .  krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe .  on the opposing end is krippendorf's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe .  it's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf's tribe could've been a real winner .  sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just aren't the right tone for this film .  cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you've got a good start .  at the state it's in now , you've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs .  doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try .  the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them .  most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated .  director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways .  it's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) .  it's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it's a brutal drop .  a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she's holding his penis ?  yes , it's put that bluntly !  just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame .

3075	synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system .  the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris .  comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film .  both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) .  interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively .  this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction .  it's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality .  unfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie .  virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) .  the film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses .  many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly .  the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles .  jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character .  carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise .  meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either .  virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background .  in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch .  the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt .  this turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either .  don't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .

3083	originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e .   " talking about love is like dancing about architecture " ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman .  plot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love .  critique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties .  how do people fall in love ?  why do people fall out of love ?  how do people fall back into love , once they've been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club ?  all of these questions and more , are touched upon in this film , within several types of variant relationships .  meet a hip , young couple going through their first date .  a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships .  a married woman " finding herself " while cheating on her husband .  a husband letting go of his inhibitions .  an older couple dealing with a past " love " of the man , a secret recently uncovered .  a son dying from aids , joined by his mother at the hospital .  there are many nuances to this picture , and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate , but more importantly , there is diversity .  diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels .  some related to the younger couples' issues .  others with the married .  there's a little bit of everything for everyone in here .  and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year , i would relate myself to yet another predicament .  just like love itself , this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels .  the actors in this film are all also very , very good .  sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve , as is gena rowlands , as the aging wife with trepidations .  jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance , while philippe is as pretty-boy as ever .  anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to re-ignite her love life , opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talk-show host , jon stewart .  even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film , and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination .  the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached , was the part surrounding jay mohr , the man dying from aids , and his mother , ellen burstyn .  the actors were fine , but somehow , the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else .  the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me , but i guess that's just hollywood .  this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors ( 5 . 5/10 ) and happiness ( 4 . 5/10 ) in concept and style , but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness .  the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care , as opposed to this film , which offers rich and believable characters , living real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships .  all in all , this movie offers many interesting characters , talking and living genuine and engaging love lives , wonderful performances by its solid cast , too sweet of an ending , but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless .  little known facts about this film and its stars : according to a story in the london sunday mirror , sean connery asked for only $60 , 000 for his role in this movie , as compared to his usual fee of $14 million , because he liked the script so much .  on top of that , he convinced his co-stars ( including gena rowlands , gillian anderson , ellen burstyn , et al . ) to do the same .  this is director/writer willard carroll second real foray into the world of " adult films " .  before this , he had written and produced many children's movies .  gillian anderson stands 5'2 .  angelina jolie's full name is angelina jolie voight .  she is actor jon voight's daughter .  she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute .  she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting ( 8 . 5/10 )  fame in 1997 .  they were married in 1995 .  actor ryan phillippe's full name is matthew ryan phillippe .  he stands 5'9 , and spent his childhood in new castle , delaware .  his acting career started on tv's " one life to live " .  he portrayed daytime television's first gay teenager .  jon stewart's full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz .  this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture .  watch for movie posters from swingers ( 8 . 5/10 ) ,  chasing amy ( 7/10 ) and the texas chainsaw massacre ( 8/10 ) at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date .

3091	for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor .  is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ?  harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ?  with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster .  it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity .  for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood .  the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) .  but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life .  the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair .  what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen .  shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives .  emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player .  patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car .  and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer .  pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it .   " why do we put up with it ? "  emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch .   " we try to talk about it , and look what happens .  we fight for 20 minutes . "  there's the admirable crux of this picture .  girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action .  but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take .  the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) .  they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall .   " subvert the patriarchy , " emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to .  the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor .  still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying .   ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . )  perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( " who you callin' a bitch ? " ) .  the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary .  long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste .  director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . 's  michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking .  the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding .  then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film .  the movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance .  truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination .  for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place .

3121	whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days .  like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control .  the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message .  the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) .  bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate .  not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus .  you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name .  what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message .  one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly .  it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot .  distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view .  you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens .  this film camera is just another one of the guys .  tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across .  bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares .  i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be .  that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted .  if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film .  stay at home and rent up close and personal .  and what's a buzz without tunes .  from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film .  good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message .  every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict .  trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations .  dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago .  he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago .  nowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production .  he is currently finishing a couple of small projects .  with his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations .

3125	john sayles' " men with guns " is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power .  the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers .  most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists .  all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness .  however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity .  there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it .  the film's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category .  one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive .  fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians .  with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate .  this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea .  however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned .  as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other .  when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , " because they had guns , and we didn't . "  rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power .  dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss .  first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father .  next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities .  through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol .  along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith .  as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching .  last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her .  sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in " men with guns . "   ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . )  he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo .  their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn't ) .  the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself .  sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in " matewan " ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in " lone star " ( 1996 ) .  sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( " gattaca " ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain .  sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects .  the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border .  it would not be a stretch to say that " men with guns " is a depressing film .  in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure .  in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being .  nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly .  the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , " nobody refuses the men with guns . "

3127	it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , " american history x " does it , and for that , i commend it .  it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off .  the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack .  he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks .  he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process .  his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them .  he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years .   " american history x " is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake .  we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides .  or at least , that's the intention .  the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to " correct " him .  when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on " mein kampf , " landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere .  coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair .  he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up .  he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle .  but danny won't .  he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago .  the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white .  we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on .  to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them .  and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true .   " american history x " is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next .  in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year .  one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) .  another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison .  and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year .  there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) .  norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble .  in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best .  there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando .  that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing .  sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be .  it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece .  the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon .  some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the " fat skinhead , " whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled .  furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there .  even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified .  though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from " boy meets world , " and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs .  as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed .  sorta .   " american history x " is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential .  somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus .  although he aimed for the directing credit to go to " alan smithee , " the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) .  kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par .  this will not be a " do the right thing " for the late 90s .  yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) .  and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .

3129	 " i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , " earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher .  with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story .  he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation .  from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .  well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion .  instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .  and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments .  instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .  when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss " sonny " dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene .  the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters .  with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims .  the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work .  robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier .  rarely has a movie been such a labor of love .  with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher .  duvall has every movement down pat .  even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy .  he dances and claps all the way .  sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive .   " i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , " he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent .  and they lap it up .  people jump up , scream , " praise the lord ! "  and mean it .  the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable .  but sonny is no saint .  it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett .  jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed .  sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever .  the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( " one way road to heaven : holiness temple " ) with an enthusiastic flock .  in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church .  he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money .  and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks .  a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , " i quit school because i didn't like recess . "  in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while .  his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .  billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker .  his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take .  although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely .  and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits .  a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .  the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .  it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .

3138	when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time .  while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good .  i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs .  in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours .  the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island .  ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w .  earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks .  it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up .  mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom .  ted was just flattered that she even knew his name .  unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital .  fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day .  with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love .  however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections .  there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin .  not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them .  with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler .  the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work .  i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on .  one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment .  one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller .  he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation .  ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out .  it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top .  actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties .  the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money .  in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler .  it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late '92/early '93 .  like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation .  cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times .  however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her .  heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week .  my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true .  he and ralph macchio must hang out or something .  maybe they live in dick clark's pool house .  anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart .  the supporting performances are also good .  chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy .  lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film .  lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist .  the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags .  the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .  they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .  it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .  after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow .  fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .  
3139	reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) .  the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .  his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .  i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , " oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "  it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .  and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?  auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's " style " , not the director's that winds up on screen .  kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " .  and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar  be damned ) .   " how did you know that ? "  the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along .   .   .  since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently .  he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .  this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .  their company's current logo could be " we ride the trends " .  reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .  although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .  affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .  the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting .  it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )  james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .  ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him .  which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .  he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .  though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant .  this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .  included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .  though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .  the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .  it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau   ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .  he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .  problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .  character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .  the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .  but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .  charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .  she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .  gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .  these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .  
3140	overall performance : - at last the long waiting aag hits the screens . unfortunately , it could n't set progressive fire in the audience . the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay . and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie . if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop , people will again say there is nothing new in this . different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy . right from the start of his career with siva in telugu , he had been using the same lighting and kind of background . i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather . it 's all dutch dutch dutch dutch . why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the shot division is lame . characters could n't carry an emotion , performances are not to their mark , storytelling is worse , background is really really terrible . babban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job . varma produced great villains like bikumatre , bhavtakur das , mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema . there 's no comparison of gabbar with babban . babban is a more psycho rather than a villain , still he has a soft corner for his brother ( it 's a gift in this movie ) . amitabhz performance is not to his mark . his appearance itself is pathetic . the scar on his nose , symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema . what ever they worked on babban is not successful . babban is no comparison with gabbar . narsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands . if varma did that , it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder . itz good he opened the secret early . but the flashback is pathetic . varma could n't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark . durga:- the only character with betterment . this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story . heroo , raj , ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character . the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz . these characters carry nothing to this movie . ramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading , diminishing . aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie . sholay is a fire of revenge , problem of a town , meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra . aag never carried an emotion with its characters . storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters . do n't compare aag with sholay , still u will not like it . if you dare watch this movie . you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag

3142	mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in town , and he's the nameless animal attraction of " mouse hunt , " dreamworks skg's clever first foray into family fare .  although it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . .  but consider that list includes dismal tripe like " air bud , " " flubber " and " that darn cat , " and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull off .  still , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i'll be hoping that the mouse from " mouse hunt " knocks some sense back into mickey .  nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from " the birdcage " ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in " the fifth element " ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion .  although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect .  but there's a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight .  movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite .  the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless .  the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of " the nightmare before christmas , " and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from " edward scissorhands . "   " mouse hunt " is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it's hardly ever mean-spirited .  the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse .  it's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick .  vicki lewis ( beth from " newsradio " ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife .  and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a " calcium deficiency . "  blech .  a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution .  their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don't think i'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share .   " mouse hunt " may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original " home alone . "

3157	this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven .  he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers .  all of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp on the violence .  in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the chest- he gets shot many times all over the body .  robocop takes place in detroit in the future .  things are pretty bleak .  the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force .  peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen .  peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed .  meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter .  someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after .  the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace .  it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting .  the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop .  nancy allen does a decent job .  this movie doesn't leave itself open for a sequel exactly .  but they made one anyway .  enter . . .  robocop 2 starring : peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner  detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film .  ocp is trying to develop an improved 'robocop 2' that will be more than a match for criminals .  most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city .  this film is pretty bizaare .  it has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor .  the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so .  there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up .  the effects are still decent though .  this sequel isn't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals .  if you liked the first one , watch this .  but be dissapointed .  so later comes . . .  robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke  ocp is now owned by a large japanese company .  robocop joins a band of rebels to counter-attack the evil empire , i mean ocp .  the japanese send a cyborg-ninja to deal with robocop .  among other things . . .  this movie is easier to follow than the last one .  which means the plot isn't quite as crowded .  this movie isn't anything special though .  just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way .  really not reccomended .

3159	this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking . jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly - created character in an ill - fated movie , thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie . the film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair . unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random " survival events " ( including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear ) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is n't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie ( and what a nightmare it is ! ) . furthermore , despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film , there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing , including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded . all in all , a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to , much less innocent kids .
3160	it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
3161	there are some good things about the movie . the music and cinematography is great . alex wilson is hot and gives a great performance . ryan bauer is also hot . the production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie . jonny vincent ( sean ) and a lot of the boys in the movie that do n't speak are cute too . why is n't the actress who plays amy listed in the credits ? brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance as clitarissa pink . the worse thing about the movie is probably the star , james townsend . he ca n't act . he 's also very scrawny , not nice to look at at all . his arms are like spaghetti . it 's disgusting . they have no muscle tone at all . it 's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it . no one else would cast him in anything . james townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay . they should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what 's best for the movie . then again , maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft - core porn , definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons . plus , anyone who does porn is blacklisted in hollywood . the most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan - skinned latina as devon 's mother . sonja fisher does not seem like an actress at all . all in all , this movie is soft - core porn and is no better than something you would see on skinemax . i think even alex wilson , probably the best thing about this movie , is embarrassed by it and does n't want to be associated with it . there is no photo on his imdb page and nothing else listed , so alex wilson is probably a disposable stage name . plus , i ran into him in west hollywood one time recently and when i mentioned this movie , he just turned around and walked away . i understand . if i had worked on this movie , i would be embarrassed and would n't want to be associated with it either .
3162	`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see .  wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic .  those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy .  awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .  although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor .  most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile .  can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?  perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . .  but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements .  the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .  a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' .  o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) .  jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage .  the problem is that his proposal sucks .  big time .  you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach .  and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) .  everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .  of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years .  the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day .  with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . .  and within a very limited time frame .  there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' .  for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? .  another is the colorful cast .  o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity .  ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures .  and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel .  the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable .  yes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute .  the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived .  the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained .  potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes .  `the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .  you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ?  o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? '  in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .  after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .  o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge .

3169	if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more .  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .  so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes .  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .  quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen .  the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough .  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named " pleasantville . "  maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .  it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like .  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness .  at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t .  walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town .  fine performances are turned in all around .  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t .  walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .  daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy .  for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .  there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't .  
3170	my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me , i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable , and you know what ? it was ! but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of . i know that this was a very cheesy movie , but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that 's what made the movie really work . jenny johnson(scary , that 's my best friend 's actual name ) is not your typical average librarian looking woman , when matt , your average male , asks her out , he 's in for more than he expected , he 's asked g - girl out on a date , the super hero of the world ! but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart , but jenny wo n't have it since he 's fallen for another girl , hannah , and she will make his life a living hell , i mean , let 's face it , he could n't have chosen a better girl to break up with . the effect were corny , but you seriously move past them quickly , the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie , it was such a step up from prime . my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you should n't really take seriously , it 's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it , anyone could . 7/10

3172	worthy of the gong . 
3173	what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker .  the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis !  i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : " first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "  and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play .  nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman .  nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ) .  on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny .  his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film .  but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind .  the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister .  this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it !  but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman .  like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader .  but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting !  keaton delivers .  he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman .  even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city .  visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team .  the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as " the dark knight returns " and " the killing joke . "  burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen .  the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations .  nicholson isn't joking when he boasts , " wait 'till they get a load of me ! "  his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous .  keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate .  batman's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop .  production designer anton furst's sets are a wonder .  gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york .  the batcave is cold , bare , and desolate .  the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption .  the movie's gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold .  the plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing .  the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting .  it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear .  batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one .  as i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings .  in terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect .  burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story .  more than anything , batman is a mood film .  while batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books .  thanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world .

3181	there is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst i have seen in some time . as f. scott fitzgerald ( gregory peck ) and sheilah graham ( deborah kerr ) are lounging on the beach , suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry -- at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past . this " dramatic scene " becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic i could n't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was ... as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo . no one experiences moments like this -- no one . now how much of the rest of the film is true , i can not say , but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $ 8 rolex -- and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct -- the film is a lot of bunk . however , i am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet did n't seem to clear this up , either .   just who were f. scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like ? what i do know about fitzgerald , however , does seem different from what i saw in the film . was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film ? well , considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like a fish , i 'd assume he was n't . was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film ? perhaps , but if he was this bad and yet ms. graham stayed with him , then this makes her out to be a complete dummy -- and not someone you 'd like to see featured in a film . and , if he was n't , then the film does a poor disservice to his memory . either way , it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience . the sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people . in a dark and salacious way , some might find this all very entertaining , but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way ! unpleasant but with glossy production values ( especially the music , which was lovely but way over the top ) it begs the question " why did they even choose to make this in the first place ? " . the bottom line -- it 's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time -- even if , like me , you are big gregory peck fan .

3185	encompassing virtual reality , the potential of computers , communication with the past , the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a constraining society , and the fascinating ada byron lovelace portrayed by the fascinating tilda swinton , this film should have been great . but it is lousy , terrible if you consider the potential ! the acting - aside from tilda swinton and karen black - veers from tolerable to atrocious . the plot construction is awkward to say the least - the modern day programmer is a dull one - note character , but half the movie is spent setting up her character , and then when ada finally appears , it is to narrate the events of her life , not to present an engaging story ( swinton almost pulls this off , though ) . you never fully get to know her as a real person , just an icon from a grad student 's history paper . the digital effects , such as a digital dog and bird , are lousy and distracting , considering it was 1997 and not 1985 . and , finally , the script is just bad . bad , often pretentious dialog - especially the fights between the programmer and her boyfriend , which made me squirm - cold and distant characters , and zero attempt to create a sense of wonder . the programmer successfully contacts a person in the past ! astonishing ! but it hardly seems to surprise anyone , and her boyfriend says , " well , be careful . " ( although we 're given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous , and it never seems to actually be dangerous . ) also , despite being about computers and ada lovelace and her love of mathematics , it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief . one scene , towards the end of the movie , is quite good , a monolog by tilda swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life . poignant , passionate , and insightful , it seems to be dropped in from another movie . so i am disappointed in this movie , because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult film . if you find the subject matter interesting , you might want to rent it , but be forewarned . see orlando for another , much much better examination of gender roles in history with a great tilda swinton performance . * * * spoiler / question : * * at the end of the movie , ada asks that her memories not be preserved ( in what i thought was the best scene in the movie ) . but then the modern day programmer seems to do it anyway , transferring the memories into her little girl ( hence the title of the movie ) . am i correct , that the programmer violated ada 's wishes without even struggling over it ? or is this another confusing plot point that i 'm misinterpreting ?

3189	what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
3190	i had to watch this in school . and to sum it up ... talentless actors , talentless script , and a talentless director . this movie is such a waste of your time . do n't even watch the movie . do n't bother . you will be so disappointed . my teacher said it was supposed to be good . how wrong she was . she even slept through it a little . the movie 's actors were just bad . the best actor in there was the old man and that 's not saying much . it 's has horrible plot with awful characters . so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point . the script was unemotional and confusing . there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said , " what ? " . also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes . it was just absolutely horrendous .
3191	it 's not a big film . the acting is not amazing ( some sub charterers are even played badly ) , the film is not beautiful in any sense . nothing really inventive or new . if you like big films , this one is not for you . yet it has a big - really big plus on the story . larry 's story works , because we know this story from our own lives . the girl we did n't ask to a date , the test we 've failed , the friend we let down , are all in our history . this movie works , because it touch it , it 's a great story because it 's a small one . it 's the life we all have , with regrets we all have , and yet the message hits : every life we could have lived would have had their downside . the first time i watched it , i was 15 . it was shown in a party at my school . 16 years later , i keep reflecting on it every once in a while , and every time i see it , it puts a smile on my face . watch it . it will do you good . you 'll be happier with what you have .

3199	when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
3200	in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .   " hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smart's got a point .  it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '  of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .  but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .   " you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "  her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .  kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .  henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .   ( respect the r , not for under 14's ) rating ----- stars .  go see it .

3204	anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless .  though good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script .  so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting .  this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops .  she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because " the ways of england are the ways of the world ) .  the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) .  the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( " father , have i offended you in some way ?  why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her .  meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma .  the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position .  she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices .  he , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other .  there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies .  it's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure .  anna then comes in and cries a bit .  the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer .  i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched .  this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren .  we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care .  this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 .  i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient .  the sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur .  even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia .  we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe .  i liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles .  foster's generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character .  yun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam's sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts .  what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations .  the cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole .  this is an emotionless costume epic .  
3205	starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see .  therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas .  despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters .  a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the " savages " that live there .  the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust .  only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash .  the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments .  the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .  governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses .  captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while " slightly " misguided , is good at heart .  pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .  she even comes complete with insignificant best friend .  again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is .  this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work .  the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation .  maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes .  the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch .  the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , " colors of the wind . "  mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more .  the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character .  i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time .  even the children in the audience seemed restless .  while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed .  perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .  it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled .  even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious .  as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film .  for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with " savages , " why did he so quickly change his previous " kill as many indians as i can " attitude .  if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .  or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ?  i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .  as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression .  in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set .  while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .  
3206	 . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
3207	while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general .  words " croatia " and " croatians " were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations .  the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context .  in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise .  same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime .  the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe .  his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro .  shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away .  after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) .  upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba .  shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war .  thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary .  it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books .  those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre .  this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires .  unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work .  the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda .  christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role .  his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate .  his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the " normal " way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends .  although the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character .  however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague .  this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director .  with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess .  luckily , the dogs of war had a good script .  irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel .  the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places .  in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes .  unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help .  but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .  
3208	i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " bachelor party " , starring tom hanks . is this movie even an official sequel ? this movie is lacking in every department and you 're obviously better off not watching it . for a comedy this movie simply is n't good or funny enough . it relies mostly on the character 's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . you just keep waiting for things to finally start off . there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it 's something non - existent . i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . it 's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . the movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . i regret ever watching this . 3/10
3209	definitely , definitely the worst film i 've ever seen , no questions asked ! contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others , since it 's an independent , low - budget film , but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying . agreeing with everything that has been said about this film , for example the mind numbingly weak acting ( when it 's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene , god damn it ) , the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script , assuming such a thing existed during the production . there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers , the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her , why do n't you ? the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is , as the rest of the film , a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully .  oh and by the way , this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand - held camera  this is an effect and not a trait ! used cleverly it can be breathtaking , but in this case it 's an excuse for inadequate cinematography .
3210	despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
3211	in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
3212	ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
3213	cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film .  a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's " black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks " to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking .  yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , " blaxploitation , " died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness .  the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft .  while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass .  this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is .  much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers .  contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff .  the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city .  however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors .  when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i .  but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime .  peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film .  peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages .  however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) .  it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless .  then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars .  bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on .  collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane .  busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan .  registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno .   ( jackson also has little to " do " in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . )  that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director .  this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases .  they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them .  these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional .  but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive .  from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado .  even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary .  style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence .  what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .  
3214	not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .  like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .  also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces .  and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .  all that is missing is a discussion of god .  which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .  in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .  nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms .  once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .  one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .  though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any " style " at all .  whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .  the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .  it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .  much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .  there are a few missteps .  for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .  this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .  and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .  for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .  it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .  in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .  there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .  nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .  though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .  needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .  but for many of us , of course , so is life .  and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .

3217	take a look at the following equation . . . .  a christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged  yes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether .  scrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy .  bill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality .  he's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way .  however , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray .  frank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean .  he also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed .  however , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either .  sadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane .  whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away .  and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . )  who , thankfully , dosen't say much .  the script is horrendous .  michael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes .  and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful .  the special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film .  there's some impressive make up effects also .  the music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman .  but great effects and make up don't make a great film .  scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech .  why didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ?  overall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague )  
3218	this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
3219	a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama .  it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past .  the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) .  her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .  her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin .  he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city .  out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about .  the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws .  chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk .  the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .  to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator .  the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book " the shovel and the loom , " goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .  it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten .  the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .  the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted .  the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith .  topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .  the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder .  but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done .  i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .  it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received .  in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past .  that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about .  unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .  
3220	whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms .  he made the west dirty in " mccabe and mrs . miller " ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in " the long goodbye " ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with " popeye " ( 1980 ) .  the same holds true for his most recent film , " the gingerbread man , " which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie .  by the time " the gingerbread man " was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham .  there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom .  instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , " the gingerbread man " is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity .  the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes .  he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds .  rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) .  a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it .  whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been " screwing around . "  after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses .  he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together .  rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers .  it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does " weird " stuff like that .  as another character puts it , dixon is " a few beers short of six-pack . "  rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency .  he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) .  dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out .  from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action .  altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look .  if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining .  gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light .  a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability .  in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world .  altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies .  but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings .   " the gingerbread man " is no different , although his style is much more restrained here .  however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller .  a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction .  here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic .  rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character .  without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration .  the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in " schindler's list " ( 1993 ) .  tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird .  it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing .  while " the gingerbread man " isn't in league with altman's greatest works like " nashville " ( 1975 ) or " the player " ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .  some critics love to stamp films like this as " commercial , " as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money .  altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .

3225	so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies .  the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' .  now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill .  the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house .  if they survive the night they get the money .  if not well you get the jurisdiction .  having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake .  but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on .  geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people .  his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends .  steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list .  somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party .  eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways .  what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night .  if they can they get the money , if not well they don't .  the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum .  years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they .  everyone who was in there burned to death .  now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people .  what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night .  the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .  one-by-one the people start to disappear .  conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all .  the people find rooms , which once held mental patients .  rooms which once had people dying .  rooms which may still contain these people .  now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results .  since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better .  i can say however i liked this movie .  geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role .  famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .  ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .  chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .  peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .  the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .  the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary .  i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .  one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .  even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell .  the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .  the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .  i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .  i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending .  instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .  house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .  though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .  but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !

3252	hollywood is a pimp .  a fat , cigar-smoking chump wearing a fur hat and 12 gold chains around its fat , hairy chest .  all of its stars and starlets are an evil brood of scum-sucking vampires looking for the next percentage take , the next summer blockbuster , the next casting couch to audition on .  pumping out comic-book adaptations , terrible sequels to mediocre films , and remakes of foreign films to the nearest american movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound systems .  how much longer can the works of peckinpah , fassbinder , fuller , castle , preminger , and lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections of the local blockbuster stores ?  how many more silver and weinstein films can we enduring in this stinky , decaying state of american cinema ?  but now , from john " i don't give a shit what you think about my movies " waters , comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and aficionados : cecil b . demented , a warped and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social revolution .  stephen dorff , in a career-defining role , is cecil b . demented , a crazed director devoted to making the most radical underground film .  together with his film production cult , the sprocket holes - who wear tattoos of peckinpah , lee , fuller , castle , anger , fassbinder , preminger on various parts of their bodies as badges of honor , they kidnap a hollywood movie starlet , played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith , and force her to take the starring role in demented's film .  with no budget and no contracts for extras , demented and his crew take to the streets for production of raving beauty , a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to destroy the mainstream film business .  using " ultimate reality " - with real bullets , real people , and real terror - demented and his crew of misfits attack a mall theater , terrorize the maryland film commission and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying tom hanks film .  demented's crewmembers are maimed and killed , popcorn machines are used for target practice , and no one can have sex until the film is complete .  it's like bowfinger , only , you know , good .  the film moves with zigs and zags like the magic bullet of kennedy's assassination .  the zeal of demented's cause catches quickly and conveys the urgent message of " doing something , anything , for the accomplishment of artistic motivations . "  the crewmembers all hold the quirkiness common in water's previous films - pink flamingos , hairspray , polyester , pecker -- and speak in the choppy , jaded dialogue used frequently by waters .  it is as if water's script strips away the unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods .  cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it might actually outdo itself .  you can see how a major studio might take this film , re-edit it , cut a deal with the remaining crew members who are still alive , and make a few sequels , a la the blair witch project .  but that's for the future .  overall , the ride is fantastic ; it's one of water's best films to date and this year's fight club for filmmakers .  director/writer : john waters starring : stephen dorff , melaine griffith , alicia witt , adrian grenier , larry gilliard jr . , mink stole , ricki lake , kevin nealon producers : john fielder , mark tarlov , anthony delorenzo , joe caraccio jr .

3266	an intriguing near-miss . 
3267	note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent .  a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking .  the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop .  as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity .  recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar .  wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his " one special thing " are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a " big bright shining star " .  his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in .  the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious .  from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question .  while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent .  it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film .  while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour .  the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded .  while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous .  a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking .  ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights .  it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters .  after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs .  larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public .  however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business .  the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided .  if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves .  jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) .  in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of " there are shadows in light , baby " to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's " it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! "  rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false .  in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark .  much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes " this is the best work i've ever done " , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness .  mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter .  while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane " how much can you bench ? "  banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges .  and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions .  still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same .  in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's " sister christian " on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard .  if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness .  there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights .  mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect .  similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing " i'm so stupid " after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening .  boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good .  while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention .  mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film .  i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee .  mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation .  worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track " you got the touch " in a vain attempt at a musical career .  mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective .  ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry .  consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp .  her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity .   ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! )  and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet .  draw your own conclusions .  perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion .  his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry .  while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable .  luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures .  jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs .  boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work .  striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year .

3278	in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it .  try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther .  in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps .  in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature .  there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich .  he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever .  the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) .  simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall .  joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is .  naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball .  in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small .  joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends .  early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other .  both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability .  the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both .  finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show .  mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic .  the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . '  along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions .  by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .  simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come .  in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .

3288	this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic .  postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview .  so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?  my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull .  no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made .  it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date .  to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at .  the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage .  but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies .  there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise .  i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you :  the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic .  we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor .  bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure .  what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage .  we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family .  rose is to be wed to a man she does not love .  we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game .  the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins .  add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy .  i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with " new money " who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship .  she is a pleasure to see on screen .  when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters .  the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on .  the effects are tremendous .  from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other .  we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen .  my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard .  when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles .  titanic runs far too long .  the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length .  and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends .  don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's  not a bad as i am making it out to be .  it really is an exceptionaly well-made film .  the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period .  the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction .  this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound .  cameron has certainly made his best film to date .  unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate .  it just doesn't have a strong supporting story .  it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside .  it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for .  i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews .  it is a film worth seeing .  i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office .  with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video .  this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts .  titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox .  i give titanic 3 stars ( .  that's not bad .  ron epstein  riginally posted in home theater forum ===

3291	vikings v . bears ?  no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football .  rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in " the 13th warrior , " a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory .  based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought .  their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword .  luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film .  antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador .  accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village .  we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude .  they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won .  but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land .  help is needed quickly .  an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives .  after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more " not of norse blood " are needed to ensure victory .  personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity .  nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th .  the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives .  of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors .  but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog .  he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ?  it does not look promising .  these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale .  they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies .  they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon .  the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods .  they are ready to sacrifice their lives .   " this is a good way to die , " says one of the fallen warriors .  despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience .  at many points , i was even confused .  for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land .  he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis .  however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion .  there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .  the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma .  however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special .  an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order .  also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow .  i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy .  as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity .  it would make thor cry .  
3292	not as bad a film as i thought it would be . it has a good cast . nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors . would like to see more of olivia d`abo in future projects . maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d`abo . also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg . hopefully we will see more uk - european co - productions like this .

3304	when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster .  now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought " what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? " .  as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy .  robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit .  don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference .  based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith .  allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer .  she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system .  her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her .  a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied " not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now " .  allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation .  her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti .  undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation .  the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave .  the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government .  the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission .  as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go .  she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation .  her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning .  at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor .  a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey .  from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen .  the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless .  many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions .  zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film .  contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within .  i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .  
3305	just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?

3318	the script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that's where this film should have remained . 
3319	the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
3320	the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
3321	no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is awful . the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series . i found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . as a bbc licence payer , after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment . i 'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone did n't object to the story lines . these actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , surly they can see it 's lost all direction . it 's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father christmas ! paul bentley , west yorkshire , england .
3322	for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
3323	a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
3324	in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
3325	the film is strictly routine . 
3326	it may not be history  but then again , what if it is ?  but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
3327	capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .  visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film .  that makes it a film without much center .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .  it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels .  humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms .  the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .  it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .  when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .  the final irony of the original version has become film history .  without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series .  i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .  in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .  that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .  justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .  but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .  few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .  partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .  when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .  while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .  the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .  now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .  first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .  that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .  as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .  in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .  then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )  he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .  and the language they talk is earth- english .  apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .  the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .  both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .  in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .  outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .  ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .  she is bent on making the world a better place .  perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .  in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .  she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .  this is a further abandonment of the source material .  the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .  we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .  we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .  burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .  this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .  they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i didn't like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .  most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .  this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .  in general it seems much improved from 1968 .  the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .  in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .  today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .  these visuals work nicely .  what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .  they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .  apes spring incredible distances .  some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .  one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .  since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .  the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .  it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .  but he delivers them very well .  he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .  as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .  in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .  he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .  as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .  danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .  i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  
3328	an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
3329	i had the " privilege " of attending a special screening of ' the absence of light ' at a horror convention in ohio . first off , you know you 're in trouble when the director introduces a film , saying : " now keep in mind , we did n't have much money ... " not that no - budget films are bad , but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse , the results are always poor . and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep - fest .   actually , ' absence of light ' marks a first in the world of underground cinema : it 's the only time i 've seen a dream - cast of talented genre vets actually bore me . charismatic actors like david hess , tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no - names . who are their characters ? what are they talking about ? who cares ? it 's all so dull , you 'll cease to care about anything or anyone . after thirty minutes of this endurance test , i gave up and walked out of the theater . not surprisingly , so did most of the cast members in attendance .   any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this . with a little luck , this movie wo n't ever see the " light " of day .
3330	see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
3331	let's say you live at the end of an airport runway .  large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace .  let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home .  now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth .  wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ?  of course you would .  but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ?  that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale .  unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice .  not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back .  the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest .  in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful .  the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets .  it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film .  i just sat back and enjoyed myself .  the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever .  what makes this film different is its characters .  darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard .  steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for " investments " like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers .  the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying .  they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing .  we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection .  screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans .  sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them .  i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works .  i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs .  don't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius .  it's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully .  instead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world .  when they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious .  one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though .  the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time .  luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable .  with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes .  i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate .  and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .

3334	when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of " mr . magoo , " special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay .  mr .  magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented .  in fact , they were wrong .  mr .  magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity .  it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas .  look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr .  magoo .  the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining .  the worst , mr .  magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be .  the first problem with mr .  magoo is the script .  despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr .  magoo is comically barren .  from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found .  every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud .  you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case .  i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures .  then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) .  in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun .  lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr .  magoo .  even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but " top form " is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here .  this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation .  the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber .  the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often .  the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) .  matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo .  the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus .  most of mr .  magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick .  the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices .  there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well .  then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby .  i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack .  tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop .  his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) .  like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream .  it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr .  magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages .  the screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn't seem to be enjoying themselves .  when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it .  her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words .  mr .  magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .

3348	soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
3349	from what i 've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film , compared to part 1 . initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be . soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che 's life that he started in part 1 . part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion . part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion . it is not soderbergh 's fault that these 2 parts of che 's life had completely different outcomes . he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way . the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che 's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director . the film is far from perfect . it is probably too long . at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes . in part 2 they ca n't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture . che 's capture and death are dealt with well . the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish . benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian . so if you 've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2 .

3360	according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers .  at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .  ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) .  hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) .  their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .  yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot .  instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .  sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband .  eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere .  the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .  unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale .  in the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .

3367	to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this .  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay .  also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending .  not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews .  so much for truth in advertising .  roland emmerich , who's later " independence day " would look like " the 400 blows " compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens .  in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it .  it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out .  they're decipherer ?  a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word .  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ?  so there is a hokey ending !  duh !  he figures it out in about a minute .  yea .  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , " jack " o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) .  why a suicidal colonel ?  for the ending !  you'll get the hang of this .  they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad .  after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid .  so they went to egypt , right ?  wrong .  they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt .  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people .  yea .  also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language .  an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( " say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "  - the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development .  by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the " outer limits " or something .  the script's terrible .  the special effects are okay , but nothing great .  the story's so weak that it's almost opaque .  the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a " full house " marathon . . . or  this .  i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all .  and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .

3370	susan granger's review of " big eden " ( jour de fete )  it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference .  there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him .  and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced .  to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam .  this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like " welcome to my world " and " achin' , breakin' heart " to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved .  in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness .  sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made .  and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular !  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " big eden " is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 .  it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end .

3375	if you have ever seen fox tv's special car chase programs , you'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action " thriller " from director john frankenheimer .  the film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on .  an irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show's natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase .  among the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) .  dierdre's groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it .  they accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again .  the briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed .  the writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless script .  the plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film .  but to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes .  they are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story .  don't get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here .  we never do find out what's in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller .

3377	it seems hal hartley 's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences . this film will be no exception to that rule . fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley 's ' henry foole ' from 1998 . the focus this time is on henry 's ex wife ( played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey ) , who is being pestered by cia goons about henry 's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings . in the interim of all of this , fay ends up on an odyssey , dealing with international spies , etc . the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half . if you 've been a fan of hal hartley in the past , this is one not to be missed . for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique , you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one ( especially if you have n't seen ' henry ' yet ) . i admired the camera work , which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography .

3379	nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- " frankenweenie , " " beetlejuice , " " batman , " " edward scissorhands , " " ed wood , " " mars attacks ! "  -- yet none of them have been horror films .   " sleepy hollow " is his first attempt to actually scare people .  i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this .  i left disappointed .  andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story " the legend of sleepy hollow . "  in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .  ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .  several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .  although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning .  he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret .  along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .  my reaction : ho-hum .  the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .  that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .  however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy .  it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal .  along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series .  a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman .   .   .  well , he's a guy without a head .   .   .  on a horse ( boo ! ) .  the performances are also awful .  although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .  ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character .  the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .  the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken .  i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only " bram stoker's dracula " and " mary shelley's frankenstein . "  coppola is an executive producer for " sleepy hollow , " and the script reflects his interest in early forms of " moving pictures , " particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion .   ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other .  when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . )  bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy .

3383	it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch .  take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like .  however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies .  it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own .  mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it .  what a crock .  if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for .  why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending .  you're fired .  let's get someone else to do it .  - i suppose honor is dead in hollywood .  the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized .  which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize .  in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money .  i miss originality in film , i really do .  i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original .  payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth .  while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman .  there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life .  and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a " bad guy " , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant .  the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 .  gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less .  he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand .  a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest .  this idea is completely stretched out .  gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with .  what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia .  $70 , 000 is like spare change to them .  they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him .  i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 .  maybe i'm being too hard on the movie .  perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie .  i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy .  that's why we're allowed to root for him .  and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard .  but he's wrong here .  i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker .  as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback .  after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ?  really , i don't care .  i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can .

3388	the worlds largest inside joke . the world 's largest , most exclusive inside joke . emulating the brash and ' everyman ' humor of office space , this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary , and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist . the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time , listening to music and writing a novel while working . these are his goals . you ca n't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when ( around halfway through ) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria , but then gives it up ! the director and screenwriter ( jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth ) completely remove the audience 's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof . apart from that major stumbling block , the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . without these asides , the audience would n't have noticed anything particularly strange . humor is only effective if it does n't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .
3389	in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as " a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . "  one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements .  the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness .  it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio .  jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) .  her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration .  also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ?  hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy .  with such an unappealing set of characters , it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving .  naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment .  ho-hum .  another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film's climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film's lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell .  that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly .  the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers .  the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something .  and then there's some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : " look at all these pickles .  just looking at them gives me such great sadness . "  as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin .  they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .

3397	as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink .

3399	imagine this .  you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training .  a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live .  you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die .  you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you .  you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood .  if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .  eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die .  this is the life of a gladiator .  you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that .  with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire .  and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script .  since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited .  >from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious .  rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania .  scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective .  it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted .  as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who .  it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch .  instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle .  he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life .  but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that .  the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies .  he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators .  all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor .  jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus .  but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes .  now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success .  a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .  you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .  phoenix plays his character brilliantly .  think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .  every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .  phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother .  crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero .  maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions .  this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate .  ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general .  the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .  the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .  gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .  along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .

3404	what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ?  you get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! !  plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it .  adventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues .  critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride .  if you don't enjoy this film , then you just don't like action movies , period !  if you're young , you'll enjoy its humor , its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times .  if you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure .  watching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible !  harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor .  now if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven !  little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture .  it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound .  actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " .  in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on .  hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .  however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well .  looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not .  an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra .  during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .  also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence .  both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom .  this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo .  the same type of opening is present in its sequels .  jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number " ob-cpo " .  this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) .  also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po .  they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark .  the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip .  as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened .  spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy .  the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed .  when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that .  when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .

3410	susan granger's review of " the watcher " ( universal )  just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga .  this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd .  to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too .  before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again .  in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . "  writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . "  plus , as reeves explains , " we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . "  after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack .  james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it .  
3411	ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web sites ?  that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net ?  that you get your best sex on the net ?  if first-time director hal salwen could shoot an entire movie of characters typing at their computers , he would .  as it is , he settles for characters talking on the phone .  denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone .  it's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call-waiting and answering machines run our lives .  the problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea .  a darn good one , but still an 80 minute-long idea .  and despite salwen's attempt at plots and sub-plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes .  you get the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone .  here's salwen's plot : while all the characters are in a dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank .  as martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines .  in the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for .  both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone .  with repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ?  denise calls up scores with some inspired moments .  mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine .   ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . )  but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie .  the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters .  and the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will .  we get the point .  the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears .  pun intended .  there's even a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven't had enough of these things already ) .  watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  
3412	veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort .  when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs .  eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake .  he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) .  when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session .  the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk .  eastwood furrows his brow .  as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent .  he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand .  but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ?  jeter doesn't know what he's talking about .  eastwood furrows his brow .  crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime .  the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs .  isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments .  but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him .  denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) .  but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera .  playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines .  when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive .  eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes .  true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star .  this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

3414	in fact , marc blitzstein 's off - broadway adaptation of " threepenny " was not so " bowdlerised " as is generally believed . ( i have a special interest in " threepenny " ; my dad was part of the first full production in the us ; u of illlinois theatre guild did it around the end of ww2 . hjitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages { neither english } , a german prompter 's script and similar sources . ) blitzstein 's adaptation -- not a " translation " -- which had the full approval of lotte lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed . the problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the mgm cast recording ( recently available on polygram on cd)(which includes beatrice arthur { as lucy , the " big complete girl " , and ca n't i see her hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on that line -- bea was a major babe in the 50 's } , paul dooley and john astin ) was heavily censored by mike curb , head of mgm records -- i mean , 17 ( i think it was ) " goddamn"s got cut to just " damn " .

3417	it is simply amazing how " the green mile " developed in its three hour running time .  based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue .  however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction .  frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in " the shawshank redemption " , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) .  through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law .  from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , " the green mile " is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners .  the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them .  the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb .  the ensemble acting in the film is perfect .  hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles .  they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles .  they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience .  the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting .  some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan .  hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie .  every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying .  it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks .  rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection .  as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others .  this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable .  the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill .  duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men .  his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause .  his pain creates pain for the viewer .  however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film .  the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at " the jerry springer show . "  the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks .  not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief .  as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction .  his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing .  greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile .  however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting .  the speed in " the green mile " is perfect .  if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others .  the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character .   " the green mile " is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene .  fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing .  if you survive the first third of " the green mile " sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

3420	mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . '  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery .  many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles .  he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth .  tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space .  dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' " mojo " , what keeps austin going with spy talents .  upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me .  the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only " quasi-evil . "  dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one .  dr . evil tells mini me , " you complete me , " in a loving manner .  dr . evil loving ?  wow !  mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body .  austin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it .  once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his " pad " , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil .  as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , " don't go there , girlfriend ! "  to the president of the united states .  many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes .  take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is .  the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing .  there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing .  the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers !  it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it .  the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , " it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . "  tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england .  i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters .  i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did .  dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film .  i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard .  also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer .  even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly .  the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor .  mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles .   ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them .  heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion .  speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments .  hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures .  the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .

3426	the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster  the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider .  when those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre .  when the life is that of jeff " the dude " leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of " what'sgoingonaroundhere " .  the marvelous sound of " the stranger " ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film .  at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up .  the dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the " laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world " , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed .  spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time .  when asked what he does for fun , he responds " bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback " .  lebowski's passion is bowling .  when he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him .  arriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them .  even worse , they urinate on his rug .  the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife .  his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment .  the " big " lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor .  the next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug .  the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there .  when he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor .  on his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks .  the penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine .  later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers .  this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences .  the kidnappers are impossibly inept .  the dude and his cronies are even worse .  every plan goes awry .  you can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues .  that's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter .  there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining .  the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into .  the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem .  walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties .  everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam .  when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet .  donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling .  when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns .  donny is " out of his league " and doesn't " have a frame of reference " .  the film is peppered with people for whom the term " character " would be an understatement .  the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde " vaginal " artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin .  the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers .  bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star .  most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler .  as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose .  the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with " jesus " ( pronounced with a " j " , not an " h " ) embroidered on the pocket .  he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail .  his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball .  bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has .  i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job .  buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly .  the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time .  it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband .  more like the coen's " raising arizona " than their hit " fargo " , " the big lebowski " demands an open mind and even more open eyes .  a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss .  there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it .  walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say .  on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .   " if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect " ?   " when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling " ?  maybe there's no real message .  perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world .  maybe that's enough .

3433	i saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of fast forward film festivals , where we would set out to rent a bunch of b - movies and vote for who picked the worst . the night we watched this , it was voted the best , due to semblance of plot and fun costuming . this is certainly a silly , kitschy , movie , to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching low - budget fluff . personally , however , i would n't recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave it 's own mark on you . it made enough of an impression on me that i 've actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few years . a good choice if you are setting out to watch bad movies . this one is fun , and i remember bouncy music ...
3434	the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
3435	humanities quest for knowledge never ends .  so a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe .  the party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) .  early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore .  they agree to give him a ride to the next village .  he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe .  very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo .  we don't have to wait too long for the giant snake .  she just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course .  our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard .  no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell .  our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp .  enjoy !  so much for the first attempt to catch her .  but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ?  our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake .  too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition .  one by one she goes after the others .  eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure .  the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned .  however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring .  whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh .  the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster .  her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down .  mostly we don't see the act of devouring .  but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part .  whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes .  maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real .  the animatronics are somewhat more believable .  but that didn't work for the strangling scenes .  don't go see the movie for the f/x .  they are everything but up-to-date .  the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team .  we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work .  a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation .  the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway .  what kind of audience is the target group for this movie ?  hard to say .  this can't be a serious horror movie , or can it ?  see for yourself .  
3436	in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
3437	this was a gem . amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham , orla brady and all the supporting cast . the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities . with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family . the title " love divided " could n't capture it any better . even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and " pogroms " are starting reminded me of russian history . the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it 's deeply hidden inside the human nature . just like in the movie the liam cunningham 's character says " the hatred had always been there under the surface " . it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story . also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful . the story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better , stronger . liam cunningham 's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be . again acting is a top notch . story is fast - paced . irish countryside is as beautiful as ever . highly recommended .

3441	i feel no hesitation in saying that " there's something about mary " is the best film that i will see all year .  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 .  it is that good of a film .  when gene siskel said this about " fargo " only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous .  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ?  but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about .  once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer .  and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special .  now for the shocker ; " mary " is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( " pink flamingos " obviously notwithstanding ) .  the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) .  forget " blazing saddles " , " animal house " and even the former king of gross-out comedy , " monty python's meaning of life " ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses .  in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is " monty python and the holy grail " ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade .  but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of " mary " ; it has a huge heart .  you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers .  they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .  they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses .  it's funny , though .  if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable .  but believe me , it is anything but .  ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) .  after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w .  early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from " scream " ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom .  in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again .  jump to the present .  after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school .  healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself .  admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired .  after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ?  somehow , the farrelly's pull it off .  the performances here are also right on target .  as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable .  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother .  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here .  i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .  as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way .  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic " saving private ryan " .  and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting .  but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ?  i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns .  there is just something about " mary " .

3450	remember tom cruise and brian brown as rival bartenders juggling bottles of booze in " cocktail " ?  remember how stupid that looked ?  and remember the scantily-clad dancers of " flashdance " getting doused with buckets of water ?  well , " coyote ugly " does those films five better ( or six better if you count john goodman ) , since here we have piper perado , maria bello , tyra banks , melanie lynskey , and izabella miko doing the absolut spinning and jiggling thing while pouring pitchers of perrier all over their semi-naked torsos .  no , goodman doesn't flip jim beams or wear anything particularly risqu ? in the film but he * does * get up on the bar and start gyrating with the rest of them .  and the central character's love interest , played by an australian actor named adam garcia , proves * he * can get up on that bar and start shimmying along with the rest of them too .  what seems to have started life as a victoria's secret photo shoot quickly deteriorates into one heck of an embarrassing movie .  violet ( perado ) is a south amboy hopeful who tries to make it big as a songwriter ( not a welder ) in new jack city .  as na ? ve as they come , she's fobbed off by music producer's receptionists by the scorn-ful and has her apartment robbed hours after touching down in chinatown .  and , like her mother before her , she gets stage fright whenever she tries to do the open mike night thing .  when she sees a trio of babe-a-licious barkeeps thumbing through a stack of $20s in an all-night diner , violet simply has to check out this bar they call coyote ugly .  lil ( bello ) , the no-nonsense owner , agrees to give violet an audition but violet blows it .  still , lil gives violet another chance .  a riot breaks out ( riots are the order of the day at 'ugly's , since the staff are relentless in flaunting their sexual wares , flambeeing the bar , and soaking the patrons with diet sprite--this is certifiable behavior in case i didn't mention it ) but violet successfully subdues the crowd by singing along to blondie's " one way or another " on the jukebox .  she's hired !  and cured , since this little episode gives her the confidence to sing in an amateur talent contest where her dad ( goodman ) , the junk food-eating , laundry-impaired toll collector , comes to see her and is as proud as punch .  the end .  
3451	umm .. i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks . lets face it ... tori spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the extent of her " talent " . the movie 's plot was weak ... i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom . if there is a good thing about this movie , i would say it 's that tommy chong 's daughter , just for the fact that she 's his daughter ... and then there is that soap - opera - ish male lead who 's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive , but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . * why does imdb require at least 10 lines ? how many more ways can you simply say " this movie sucks " ?

3454	starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen .  freeway is giving me second thoughts .  freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood .  only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) .  to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed .  keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star .  so what are they doing in this movie ?  after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question .  you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review .  the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary .  i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it .  note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ?  because you keep making movies like this .  note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ?  note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway .  bottom line -- i'm still shaking my head .  don't waste your time on this turkey .  if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns .  reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller .  do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .  
3455	begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
3456	everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . '  in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience .  the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches .  dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches .  the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone .  'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .  the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's  humans .  that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .  what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .  perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become .  if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .  the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .  there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .  if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense .  in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .  there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch .  the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .  the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average .  sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .  the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever .  their reasonable good fun , however .  mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .  like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .  it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .  but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong .  a good opportunity , then , wasted .  a shame .  overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998  
3457	a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
3458	movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .  we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .  this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .  the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .  so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .  in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .  and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .  this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? )  far too annoying far too often .  like in 1998s " bulworth " , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character .  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .   " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement .  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well ,  he'd be a good screenwriter .  instead , this project may have sunk his career .  he wrote the ( ha ha ! )  script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .  the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .  after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " .  nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .  first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .  she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .  hey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . .  maybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .  crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .  he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show .  crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal's understudy .  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's " not a whore " .  that's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous .  of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that .  we're supposed to root for her .  no way !  she's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .  the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .  it sure ain't character development !  plummer also appeared in " speed " in '94 in a smaller , yet better role .  this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " .  that picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s .  now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too .  his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " , but we don't learn anything about him .  he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .  is he a villain ?  who cares !  ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit .  everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .  what few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is .  everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .  it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .  if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?  it's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage .  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .  after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .  oops , they're bad actors , too .  well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .  useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen .  
3459	good show . the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads . there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced . mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs , but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys ? there is moral decadence in a virtual world . there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention . i predict ( based on the bsg background ) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery . in addition to this , there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves . this show is not bsg -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making . there are not a lot of shoot - em - up or space - based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far . what it does have are very good stories , characters , and themes . it also has good performances from the actors . they can make a culture which is similar to modern - day society , but alien at the same time be completely believable . like bsg , this show is about humanity - our strengths , weaknesses , potential , and flaws . it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties , antique cars , and chicken . but those things are really more to create a semi - familiar background than anything else . anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point . whether you are from a mafia - style culture or an affluent and high - tech culture , humans and human nature are n't that different 150,000 years ago in a high - tech past than what we see in the world today . wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something .

3462	as far as " mystery men " is concerned , the burning question is less " is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer ? "   ( the answer there is an unequivocal " yes " ) and more " how in the name of sweet jesus did first-time director kinka usher get such a first-rate cast to act in this muck ? "   " mystery men " features greg kinnear as the heavily-sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis ( singular ) casanova frankenstein .  a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title , who join forces to get c . amazing out of a tight spot when c . frankenstein puts the screws on champion city .  there's william h . macy as the mild-mannered shoveler , hank azaria as the cutlery-flinging blue raja ( no knives , but a phony english accent that's just as sharp ) , ben stiller as mr . furious ( whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar ) , janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her father's skull interestingly preserved , wes studi as a rhetoric-spouting cowled avenger , and kel mitchell as the token ( and , adding insult to injury , invisible ! )  black guy .  bringing up the rear , so to speak , is paul reubens ( yes , that's pee wee herman paul reubens ) as . . .  well , let's just call him the gas man .  the production design is overblown , the special effects are overdone , and the script ( based on bob burden's " dark horse " comic book series ) is overbaked .  the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar , but they can't begin to save " mystery men " --it's just one big mess .  you're better off renting the video and pressing fast-forward to get to the funny bits .  i believe i counted three .

3476	in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title .  one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey .  quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat .  the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such .  without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character .  following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives .  i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is .  if there were ever a clear case for " less is more , " this would be it .  the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene .  by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily .  in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis .  a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator .  or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image .  william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , " well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it . "  great stuff .  the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible .  we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him .  there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between .  this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down .  he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance .  julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior .  anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion .  this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast .  most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh .  hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst .  it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation .  roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type .  for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass .  whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying " eight months later , " michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him .  another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air .  we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below .  music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect .  it's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video .  at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate .  notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it .  for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?  
3477	i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again .  and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) .  this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite .  contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 .  this one , however , is shockingly not bad .  in fact , it's actually good .  not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining .  because it's cute and innocent fun .  because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .  because the lead star is immensely appealing .  because the parents are also immensely appealing .  and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun .  there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid .  i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third .  i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's " wonderful world of disney , " where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week .  i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like " lady and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) .  and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing .  i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original " parent trap . "  it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version .  it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it .  i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age .  watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence .  and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better .  this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way .  it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right .  the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way .  and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults .  the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .  one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer .  she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing .  the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming .  they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged .  they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin .  there , they become friends , then learn about eachother .  once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of .  they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best .  lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original .  but she comes off just as appealing as she did once .  she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively .  she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect .  she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films .  she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing .  dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan .  ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) .  the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film .  instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films .  this all brings this new " parent trap " to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time .  this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore .  like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : " it takes two " starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around .  and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew .  however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better .  certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .  i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear .  and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom .  the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences .  as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .

3492	billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy .  he tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication .  sammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes .  he's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in romania .  but in a turn of bad luck , sammy wrecks his car . . . only  to be mysteriously saved by a giant ( gheorghe muresan ) .  but this giant has a heart of gold .  he leads a solitary life , helping out the monks at a local monastery .  his only longing is for his long lost love , lilianna ( joanna pacula ) , who has since moved to america .  sammy , seeing a golden ticket , convinces max to become an actor ( represented by sammy , of course ) , and come back to america .  and so sam and max bounce from pathetic job to pathetic job , with sammy dangling a meeting with lilianna as a carrot before max's nose .  but slowly sammy's deceptions begin to haunt him .  but will he develop a conscience before the innocent max becomes disillusioned .  the humor in my giant isn't the world's greatest .  mostly , it falls under the category of " boy . . . he's  so big ! " ,  and that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries .  still , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments .  the film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself .  between executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos .  maybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor !  gheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all , and his thick cotton-mouthed accent certainly doesn't help .  in fact the only thing he adds to the role is his immense stature .  originally , the concept was designed several years ago for andre the giant .  andre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something  muresan should have studied for some pointers .  why does billy crystal continually get caught in these pathetic comedies ?  he's proven that he can be much funnier than these formulaic films allow him to be , and yet , like a glutton for punishment , he keeps coming back .  that doesn't mean we have to .

3495	i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films .  i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them .  so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work .  i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning .  sigourney weaver , whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her .  in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being .  im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now well just ignore it and move on .  why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ?  well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature .  these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research .  they ( yawn ) were wrong .  it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth .  theres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film , do it well .   i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me .  alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one .  there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot .  in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off .  another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to .  fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable .  if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right .  one exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results .  but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis .  so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man , what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is .  oh , and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat .  so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie

3498	shlock - merchant leo fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy , barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy , barely coherent horror .   a wimpy orlando bloom type called ilias , from some society vaguely resembling ancient greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil , where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf - man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress . wackiness ensues . the sorceress , is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself . she sends various minions , each weirder than the last , after our heroes who win through in the end , striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere . this movie contains a steady stream of wtf ? elements and moments . for some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen . this may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks . either way , it failed . there is no atmosphere , unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks . the wolf - man minions look like a poor man 's wookie . for some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion , six million dollar man style , toward our heroes when they attack . there are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time . the other minions of the topless sorceress , other than the generic leather clad humans , are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs . needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay hispanic , lisping daleks . the fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful . oh yeah , the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of doctor who would have been embarrassed to have used . ilias , our nominal hero is bland and forgettable . he also looks a complete wuss , especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair , and is clearly a moron . sure , he 's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil . needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero , mace . when he meets ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type , claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies , traipsing the misty hills together . mace promises to take ilias with him in return for bow related favours . ilias asks where he is going . " wherever my legs take me , " is his reply . good enough for ilias . mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite . he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals , citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean . he says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals . he is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason . not long after they meet , he is testing out ilias ' bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman , minding his own business , walking along and mace shoots him dead . there is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even ilias , who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society does n't even raise an eyebrow .   the films villainess is quite unusual . for the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g - string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head . it 's like fulci included her to make the movies obligatory t&a quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute . she spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like ilias . wow , such symbolism ! later on in the movie she wimps out when she ca n't beat ilias and mace and promises to make herself the sex - slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her . hardly the world 's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women 's rights . i think he sic 's the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates mace in a situation where there is no no - one else around but mace to fool . was he really worthy trading your self respect for , ocron ?   there are quite a few other wtf ? moments . most of them come toward the end of the movie . ilias wusses out , i forget why , possibly his permed hairdo got mussed , but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid mace in fighting the forces of evil . all of a sudden , for no reason , his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy . the bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary . needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured mace . the climax is also rather nonsensical . mace decimates ocron 's remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability . he then is able to shoot ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity . she starts dying . her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous muppet head . she staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog . mace smiles . roll credits . strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused . any one who has seen wizards of the lost kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be .
3499	van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film , as indeed must every single individual involved . to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish . production values are somewhere between the original series of ' crossroads ' and ' prisoner cell block h ' . most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot . as for the acting performances , if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable ' story ' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit - roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in ' maiden voyage ' . worse still , you ca n't even fast forward to the sex scenes , because there are n't any . an appallingly dreadful film .

3508	hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .  they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment .  the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .  originally rated nc-17 for language .  not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .  killing zoe ===========  remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery .  eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers .  he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go .  though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino .  in english and french .  the road to wellville =====================  based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far .  bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation .  he also invented the cornflake .  really .  checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy .  leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey .  the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama .  what he ends up with is something that i can't print here .  phew !  stargate ========  lawrence of arabia meets star wars .  this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else .  director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on .  the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history .  that said , there's still plenty to watch here .  sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader .  he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that " somebody else " built the pyramids .  less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame .  star trek generations =====================  trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best .  the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long .  the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch .  and so on .   ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . )  original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead " get a life . "  remarkably unremarkable .  miracle on 34th street ======================  in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary .  john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .  the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle .  his chemistry with children can moisten any eye .  no claus for alarm .  junior ======  arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ?  sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie .  what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along .  director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect .  don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie .  how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ?

3510	capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .  wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis .  what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ?  how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?  the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .   , high +2 ( -4 to +4 )  in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists .  szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope .  it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .  ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .  maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor .  when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen .  after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .  he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .  from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .  as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .  there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .  perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed .  if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth .  in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .  where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .  it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .  when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .  perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is .  we are given clues to something but they are never tied up .  in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .  the film is basically a stage play .  the visual is not very important .  corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .  as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing .  i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice .  at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say " jan 16 tues . "  a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .  the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 .  a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ]  
3511	almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could .  lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " .  it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies .  hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch .  there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears .  and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing .  gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered .  and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and " newbie " , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat .  the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan's red october .  if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach .

3515	a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche .  a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche .  a bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche .  a crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche .  at an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche .  complaining about cliches = cliche .  ok , ok .  so we always hear about cliches .  but if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it !  not one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn't a cut and paste example of everything we've ever seen .  they might as well use this as a training film : " how to make a bank robbery film in the 90's " .  karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison .  she wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn't even know she's alive .  aware of mccoy's bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past .  he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt .  and if she refuses ?  who knows what he'll do to the kid .   ( cue sinister laughter )  this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it's hard to know where to begin .  the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant .  i can't stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot " twist " , etc . , is so damn generic that you'll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera .  basinger is absolutely vacant .  and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ?  here's someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we're supposed to feel sorry for her .  as she confronts her son , who doesn't even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ?  especially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever .  i suppose i should mention val kilmer .  yeah , that's right - he's in it !  quite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name .  and he got second billing !  to be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j . t .  barker .  unfortunately the script doesn't allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) ,  we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project .  the real mccoy just can't keep it's head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie .  the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt's trite dialogue , falls like the niagra .  this is definitely one to avoid , folks .  the real mccoy is anything but !

3521	this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
3522	i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .  take the professional , for example .  it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .  it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .  the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .  the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .  one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .  her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a .  agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off .  leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .  the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .  writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .  there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting .  but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe .  the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .  leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .  jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .  natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either .  besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .  a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .  gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .  there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .  a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way .  there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .  but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .  this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .  a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .

3526	old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches  soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body .  jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both .  often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes .  without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams .  warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy .  they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle .  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies .  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers .  todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype .  chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine .  his childhood is cruelty and competition .  he is indoctrinated with the big rules .  never question authority .  winning is everything .  strength beats knowledge .  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete .  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger .  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world .  obviously our hero is still alive .  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health .  when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world .  they are the other good guys .  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons .  todd finds himself in the role of protector .  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .  the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion .  the plot is old hat .  we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers .  hardly anything makes sense .  the film's science fares badly .  with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid .  after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away .  even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines .  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 .  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable .  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him .  it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer .  is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ?  who would you guess wins ?  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy .  todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse .  later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion .  supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous .  dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash .  responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic " the fifth element " , director paul anderson sees the film as " shane " in outer space .  maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode .  the movie doesn't even work as an action film .  there is never a question as to the outcome .  somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd .  the acting isn't anything to write home about .  nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim .  russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge .  uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space .  gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role .  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool .  sometimes the sets are impressive .  unfortunately " occasionally " and " sometimes " don't make a film .  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote " blade runner " , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made .  sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film .  peoples says that this is not a " blade runner " sequel , but a " sidequel " that takes place in the same universe .  although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the " blade runner " replicants watch to pass time .  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .

3536	 " knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie .  it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year .  i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found .  jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods .  rob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays . . .  actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be .  she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there .  many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick .  where chan comes off as endearing in his " normal guy " character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp .  we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions .  to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear .  the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong .  tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , " double team " ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration .  we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe .  fabulous !  seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away .  for example , look at sam raimi .   " army of darkness " , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story .  that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp .  the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * " knock off " to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more .  another problem with the film is that it looks cheap .  the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night .  and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed .  even the stars .  and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent .  for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window .  the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed .  seconds later , the car drives off at full speed .  hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere .  finally , the acting .  nobody gives a good performance in this film .  van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing " everyman " .  and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene .  even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . .  once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be .  in case i haven't yet made it clear enough , " knock off " is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade .  and it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny .  it's too inept to be funny .  there are no redeeming factors in " knock off " and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased .

3539	although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right .  billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . )  ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help .  but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out .  all done in a comic fashion , of course .  although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride .  billy crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act .  he's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny .  robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny .  he's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine .  lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen .  the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . )  the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking .  it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in .  spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather .  the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun .  there's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason .  it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script .  unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know .  harold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack .  all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience .  the script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory .  the film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll .  analyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching .  robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . )  crystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome .  it's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated .  
3540	the dialogue was pretty dreadful . the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents . not visually stunning . actually visually annoying at times . most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button . if you could watch it for free , have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady ... well maybe i 'd recommend it to you , but not anyone else i could think of at the moment .

3556	the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one .  it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his " attorney " dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) .  these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path .  duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won .  he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference .  fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs .  it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark .  director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them .  they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles .  the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand .  all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture .  thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , " riding the wave " of something that seemed special and important .  now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it .  materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the " american dream " of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever .  the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment .  in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements .  yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance .  the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations .  unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo .  during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either .  by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner .  duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change .  this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience .  while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that .  there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant .  unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs .  in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism .  indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them .  i'm not sure if he's any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .

3561	no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .  on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) .  on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them .  however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing .  what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .  think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand .  anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens .  the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .  in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , " that movie was so unfunny ! "   " i didn't know what to expect .  it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it .  i still don't know how to react .

3562	at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .  that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .  but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .  the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays .  four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .  the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty .  kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve .  he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him .  the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .  the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .  nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back .  the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .  on his way up the stairs , he tells her that " families suck " and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .  that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .  in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him .  it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .  first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .  they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .  meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .  he's finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true .  he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .  slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .  he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) .  he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring .  the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house .  macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor .  still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing .  for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as " santa " is getting in his car .  kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .  he learned how to deal with the furnace .  you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore .  he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man .  they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .  finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .  this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert .  it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .  on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .  john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .  but it does have its flaws .  the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well .  as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .  the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .  instead of " i'm gonna get that kid " they say " i'm gonna kill that kid . "  some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree .  mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .  i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .  don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .

3573	i 've always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd . frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one . when we first meet frank in the film 's title role , he 's the brother of a notorious gunfighter who 's out of town at the moment . the brother strikes terror in the heart 's of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow . only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him . she 's the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams . two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra 's brother and he 's coming to his town to take over . they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town . kirk follows him . overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone . it 's a well acted performance , almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm . pity for some reason this has not been seen for years . two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark . and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen . he 's a villain of incredible malevolence , pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen . however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with . let 's just say i believe johnny concho was mgm 's answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .

3576	i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy .  it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless .  i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 .  in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing .  more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship .  the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant .  in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage .  it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years .  convinced despite his reservations that it's time to " sh * t or get off the pot , " jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly .  anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will .  jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child .  there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends .  it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters .  at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist .  screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs .  from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees .  it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development .  by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless .  and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness .  there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake .  the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged .  and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation .  the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion .  i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks .  far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church .  you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem .  nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to .  the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity .  it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions .  we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse .  the bachelor is love among the mannequins .

3586	last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .  based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west .  but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again .  and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .  i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?  the answer is just about everything .  wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .  there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .  but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .  at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting .  will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series .  my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .  smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .  he's too much of a joker .  i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible .  what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .  the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .  the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent .  loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .  one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .  the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .  unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem .  wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works .  most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival .  if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .  kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .  salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .  branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .  but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .  rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is .  i suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .  wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .  but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .  perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie .  after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

3593	after having heard so many critics describe " return to me " as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ?  what made " return to me " old-fashioned and old-hollywood ?  was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ?  was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ?  the charisma of the two leads ?  even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances .  i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such .  which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- " return to me " was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider .  it was traditional , magical .  we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in .  it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings .  the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction .  from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the " return to me " ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet .  the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy .  real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice .  we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence .  the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal .  everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film .  >from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes .  from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints .  from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part .   " return to me " has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist .  we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father .  whatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors .  disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written .  duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder .  instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of " the x-files . "  duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen .  minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer .  though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses .  while " return to me " functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop .  the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart .  we already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point .  as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless .  the main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) .  however , in the spirit of " return to me , " it won't do to be too picky about how " old " hollywood tells its stories .  i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt .  it shows .  the bottom line : " return to me " is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined .  
3594	 " the beach " is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder .  every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment .  but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of " blue lagoon " .  forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of " lord of the flies " where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs .  by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about .  the main character of " the beach " is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) .  he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time .  richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown .  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for .  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) .  he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis .  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen .  moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life .  captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey .  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's .  once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise .  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard .  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand .  it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view .  and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers .  for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards .  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark .  there are several ideas that are introduced in " the beach " and each one could merit its own feature-length film .  there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle .  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred .  dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through .  consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .  
3595	the sword fighting was out of this world , the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques ( until the end ) that are way too common today . the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie . the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were cliché but the movie is comfortable with it . an injection of humour from woo . the plot with it 's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you could n't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on .   a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises . the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung - fu flicks do n't .

3602	whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mst3 k version , you can only be impressed by the utter gall that went into this production . the filmmakers insult the viewer 's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously could n't care less that they are doing so . everything about it is rock - bottom cheap . even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was hauled out of a junkyard . the " hobgoblins " are , as you probably know , " realized " with badly - crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys ; when a person is supposed to be attacked by them , it 's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body . when the critters scurry away from the two security guards , this is shown ( or rather , not shown ) by the camera aiming up at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins scurrying past . it 's reminiscent of the scene in the film " tangents " where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world , surveying the wreckage , and we are n't shown any of it . budget constraints alloyed with utter incompetence generally mean you wo n't have anything worth showing , so why try ? the " sets " were utterly laughable . " club scum " was an obvious diner ; the house appears to have been a vacant house --probably for rent or sale-- which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot . the " spacecraft " is something i would have been ashamed to build when i was a model - making 10 year - old . the motivations of the characters make no sense-- kevin gets denigrated by his worthless ingrate of a girlfriend because he has n't made her " proud of him . " i 'm sure this was intended to make their reconciliation oh so touching at the end , but any guy with real self - respect would have told her to go to hell and left her . nick is supposedly back from 2 months of army training ( yeah , nice regulation haircut , nick , ) and seems bent on proving that our country is being defended by sadistic , moronic animals who are sex maniacs . kyle is a phone - sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex - clad dominatrix type , but he 's so effeminate that he 's more likely gay than not . one of the girls is a prude and the other is a sleaze . and the hobgoblins ? at the end they all head back to the vault where they 've lived for 30 years . why ? who knows ? who cares ? watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film - making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script , incompetent direction , actors who are so bad they 'd be rejected from a high school theater production , and sets worthy of edward d. wood , jr.

3616	  as usual , i was really looking forward to a new tv / film on a favourite subject of mine - makes a nice change from a * strangely familiar * documentary about kursk or stalingrad on the history channel . i avidly looked forward to pearl harbour and enemy at the gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent , stupid - ifying power of hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe . so yet again i got excited about ' the rise of evil ' , especially as i heard that ian kershaw was involved , as i 've enjoyed his books . i can see why he quit . to quote some guy responsible for this rubbish : " the kershaw book was an academic piece , " he said . " it was quite dry . we needed more incidents . "   incidents ? are they totally nuts ? hitler 's life can not be said to be without ' incident ' - yes kershaw 's two volume hitler biographies were long and detailed , but they were supposed to be . the thesis behind ' rise of evil ' seems to be : hitler was a very bad man - no he was a very bad man , who hated jews , and just in case you miss this , we 're going to emphasise the fact in every scene in the film . there was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time , and why hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did . needless to say - unlike the generally excellent ' nazis - a warning from history ' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the munich communist rising were jewish , and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the nazi era . but there was not much understanding to be done - the film - makers were n't going to go there , so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway . we certainly do n't get the fascinating fact that kershaw alludes to , which has hitler briefly being a socialist / communist immediately after ww1 . that would of course be far too complex for the film to handle , and might even detract from the relentless ' he was very bad ' mantra which bangs away incessantly . we know he was a bad man . however , we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations . he could be polite and even sympathetic , and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism , anti - alcohol and anti - smoking that many guardian readers could agree with . he was also famously fond of animals , hence why that wholly invented dog - flogging scene was so absurd . he was also , from all the accounts i 've seen , a brave soldier in ww1 . whilst we saw him with his iron cross , we never get to see how he won it ( acts of bravery were not in the script , needless to say ) . we also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences , whilst sassoon , owen , brook , remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience . and again , like the point above re the jewish / bolshevik link , this is vital to anyone 's understanding about the subject . why did he love war so much ? why did he think it was always a good idea , despite massive evidence to the contrary ? why did n't he care about his colleagues who died ? or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions . this film certainly did n't have anything of any interest to say on this either . as all too often these days , the film is a classic example of ' making history relevant to the present ' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with ' the present ' - which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator , where you do n't trust your audience an inch , so you just ram stuff down their throats , knowing ( sadly correctly ) that you 'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world . history is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present , for better and for worse . this rubbish was a great opportunity , lost again . they spent millions on it , and the locations and large scenes were impressive , but told us nothing at all we did n't know already , and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history . wt

3619	undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin ' 80 's , which admittedly does n't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub - genre like " hard rock zombies , " " blood tracks , " " terror on tour , " and the especially ungodly jon - mikl thor - starring stinker " rock'n'roll nightmare " tended to be . that aside , this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f / x razzle - dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80 's teen - targeted scarefest . moreover , the film 's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80 's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self - righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil 's music are very clever and on the money funny ( famed greed decade heavy metal god ozzy osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti - metal tv evangelist ! ) . marc price ( the hopelessly dweeby skippy on " family ties " ) gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as eddie " ragman " weinbauer , a geeky , socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who 's constantly picked on by the stuck - up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at lakeridge high school ( the cruelty and mean - spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy ) . eddie 's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol sammi curr ( an impressively whacked - out portrayal by tony fields ) perishes in a hotel fire . hip local disc jockey nuke ( kiss front - man gene simmons in a cool cameo ) hooks eddie up with sammi 's final , unreleased album , which when played backwards resurrects curr 's malevolent spirit back from the dead . sammi encourages eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor eddie 's life the proverbial living hell , only to have meek eddie prove to be a most reluctant would - be accomplice . it 's up to eddie , assisted by token nice girl leslie graham ( likeably essayed by the lovely lisa orgolini ) , to stop sammi before things get too out of hand . ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor charles martin smith ( who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher ) , smartly written by michael s. murphy , joel soisson , and rhet topham , and capably acted by a uniformly up - to - snuff cast , this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty " jump " moments ( an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long - tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight ) , a rousing " carrie "- style high school dance slaughter sequence , a neatly utilized halloween setting , revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business , and a solid central message that you should n't make a particular over - hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti - establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status .

3625	synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro .  the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts .  comments : " star trek : the next generation " was a hugely successful sequel tv series to " star trek , " a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s .  even though it still enjoyed high ratings , " star trek : the next generation " ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original " star trek " 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise .  star trek : insurrection is the ninth " star trek " movie and the third to focus on the " star trek : the next generation " crew .  star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between " okay " and " good . "  after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant " star trek : voyager " tv series , " star trek " fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise .  i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies .  most people reading this probably haven't followed " star trek " anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best .  let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie .  okay . let's move to the movie itself .  star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners .  this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy .  much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew .  audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times .  star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld .  forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show .  this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a .  it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state .  the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties .  sound pretty heavy ?  it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor .  when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .  in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at .  the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good .  since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .  the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb .  brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .  the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .  despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough .  ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .  like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .  in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .  ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations .   ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . )  donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with .  murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .  this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with .  in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .  a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .  for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing .  they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .  the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .  the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain .  despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film .  it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .  i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .  rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .

3632	i have to say , when " pushing daisies " came out i was immediately won out by the fairy - tale like setting of such grimness . the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as , well , ned ( lee pace ) baking pies . and that bringing them back to life was just as routine . the trio of ned , emerson cod ( chi mcbride ) and charlotte " chuck " charles ( anna friel ) , plus sometimes - sidekick olive snook ( kristin chenoweth , who made the musical wicked such a delight ) made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness . it definitely deserves the title of a ( romantic ) comedy / drama . ned and chuck made for a shy and not - quite - ready - for - love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they can not touch - an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves , cellophane , and quirky schedules around the apartment . but despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know , they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the beehives . the presence of olive , though , makes for some break - out - in - song moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple . second season sharply declined , putting a damper on a show that had real potential . on some of the episodes , the plot line was rushed and awkward , making you ask " what just happened ? " in both the overall dead - person - of - the - week plot and in the overriding plot line . the addition of chuck 's father plus two half - brothers for ned did n't help , and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled ( did n't the episode " comfort food " feel like the episode " bitter sweets " in the fact that the dead - person - of - the - week died in food ? ) . a few touching moments ( the beehives ) happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned , but every time they got close , the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop ( oliver comes back from the monastery , chuck 's dead father comes back to life and does n't go back , you get the picture ) . shame it did n't work out , but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way , just enough pleasantvillesque color / happy - smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it 's not " dead like me . " then again , it 's in " pushing daisies time , " according to creator bryan fuller , so it makes it plausible again . it should have lasted longer , but it 's merely wistful thinking at this point . kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short - lived gem .
3633	time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe .  this map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time .  the supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . .  during the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen .  but , according to randall , they are just " borrowing " it .  kevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling .  he joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies .  their first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding .  from here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself .  eventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery .  kevin accidentally saved the king's life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son .  but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic .  meanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him .  when randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains " the most fabulous object in the world " , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there .  once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive .  time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone .  with a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone .  terry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly .  and finally , if you liked labyrinth , you'll love time bandits .

3639	chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying .  i think i fall into the former category ( i'm one of the few who thought his turn in " the fifth element " as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle " money talks " just doesn't do him service .  tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he's also really the only thing good about the movie .  in fact , if you see " money talks , " it should shock you beyond recognition that two of " toy story " 's writers penned the sloppy script .  tucker's role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) .  after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) .  but villard's thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo .  the local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture .  he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview .  this means james must present his new " friend " in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) .  and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james .   " this ain't no buddy movie , " claim the print ads .  yeah , right .  actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears " money talks " has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker .  this is tucker's first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role .  but you realize all too quickly that tucker's overstated liveliness is the only thing " money talks " has going for it .  and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make .  it's all too easy to pick out everything wrong with " money talks . "  the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when " nothing to lose " employed it last month .  everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers .  the villains , as many as there are , are dull .  certain story elements are too coincidental .  and too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight .  a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( " you brought a killer into my parents' house ! " )  is extremely silly .  you get the picture .  obviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at " money talks . "  but the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) .  but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie's best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone's son at james and grace's engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics .  tucker's audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like " money talks . "  those who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails .

3647	romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant .  with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination .  those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay .  call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well .  gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife .  his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character .  jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money .  when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out .  gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored .  in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider .  demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world .  this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can't remember seeing a character quite like her .  after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety .  what a woman !  lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film .  anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife .  there is little insight into her character .  she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house .  juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it .  both women were anything but sexy or attractive .  poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems .  it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something .  for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene .  fine .  jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite .  fine .  what does jack proceed to do ?  he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss .  why ?  the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite .  i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . .  or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw .  she proceeded to set the place on fire .  wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ?  aren't dental records more important ?  as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ?   ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . )  lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film .  this film doesn't even add up the large details .  there is little or no consistency in the story-line .  not much makes sense .  the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable .  the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one .  so while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva .  there's plenty more to tear apart in this film .  my advice to someone who hasn't seen it to to wait until it comes on video .  there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously .  it's not a boring film , just not a good one .  or an intelligent one .  
3648	this is indeed quite the strange movie ... first , we have an ex - u.s .- gymnast trying to turn actor ( or something ) , and this seems to be the only role he ever got ( that i know of anyway ) -- and for good reason . while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest , it is a rather bland and flat performance . second , we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie ! ! ! i 'm not kidding . this alone makes the movie extremely comical , but in that annoying way . hehe and third , while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast ( including the required hot chick ! ) , an actually not - so - bad story , and some cool visuals ; the dialogue , fight scenes involving gymnastics ( hilarious ! ) , and overall execution of the plot are weak . this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie ( too bad fox was n't around in 1985 ) . it 's one of those movies that 's simply bad , yet you ca n't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it , especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable .

3658	there are people claiming this is another " bad language " ultra violence mexican movie . they are right , but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become . the awful truth hurts , or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal . one of the most important things of " cero y van cuatro " is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity . is that what we all are ? is that all that we want to be ? i am abroad and i realized how spoiled is the mexican society when the tlahuac incident came to light . i still can not understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder . i nearly puked when i saw some of the images . it was not irak or rwanda , just a tiny village near mexico city when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government . the recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply . the other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption , dishonesty , betrayal and violence , but i consider " tamales de chivo " the best one . the movie is deeper than some " cabrón " and " pendejo " screams . those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people . with a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish . just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country . moreover , honesty is only rewarded miraculously .
3659	 " with all that education , you should know what happiness is . "  starring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung  every country has , eventually , its new wave .  france had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on .  some waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery .  taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central .  it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering .  later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence .  that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice .  it does not lack ambition .  it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling .  jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents .  no one is happy .  jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age .  at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other .  but it goes wrong .  that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise .  the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured .  it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college .  both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness .  their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate .  it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't .  the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy .  for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins .  the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan .  seen now , it does not seem provocative .  indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull .  and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined .  nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material .  there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief .  too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted .  perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating .  but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties .  at two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded .  consider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach .  the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation .  even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point .  needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout .  the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative .  it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it's his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's leading cinematographers .  in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image .  you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle's inexperience or yang's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible .  in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .

3664	[cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy . 
3665	ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film .  it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) .  the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting .  the story is very minimal and basic .  there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) .  they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming .  when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) .  gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans .  on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties .  sounds great huh , well it's not .  the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work .  the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds .  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa .  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back .  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage .  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor .  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan .  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw .  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face .  now what didn't work in this movie ?  that would be the rest of it .  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets .  the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road .  it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless .  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way .  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie .  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set .  also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in .  i like wrestling .  i watch it at home and laugh .  it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it .  this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv .  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently .  the movie was too dim-witted to be funny .  it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever .  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city .  that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film .  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh .  now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads .  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox .  he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good .  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's " bawitdaba " and " cowboy " .  martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne .  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin .  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it .  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real .  the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up .  it's utterly ridiculous .  the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience .  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers .  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie .  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it .  if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining .  the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes .  oh and the girls are hotter .  is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?  don't waste your money .  
3666	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
3667	that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into " the wedding singer , " the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus .  does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ?  or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ?  or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ?  well , there's a little bit of all of that in " the wedding singer " and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time .  that's because , in a nutshell , " the wedding singer " is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across .  that's right .  sweet .  the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ?  well , it's just lovely .  i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence .  instead ?  well , i've said it before .  sweet .  the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for .  when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) .  it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love .  aww . . .  sandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film .  writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion .  it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans .  herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s .  the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's " white wedding " to the smiths' " how soon is now ? "  to culture club's " do you really want to hurt me ? "  the mix of music and fashion would make " the wedding singer " a great double feature with " boogie nights . "  if you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then " the wedding singer " is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride .  if you're a fan of the lovable , laughable adam sandler , well . . .  let's just say that " the wedding singer " might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent " happy gilmore .

3669	the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
3670	if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s ( in l.a. ) then you 've missed a special treat . this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today 's world in which we live in . it covers everything from raising a child , prejudice ( more than one way),love , adultery , empty nest syndrome , selfishness , etc .. and the list goes on . this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life . it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life . makes us ask questions of ourselves . have we done enough for others , are we like this , etc . ? ? ? sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i 'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime . take note of mary mcdonnell , kevin kline and danny glover 's wonderful performance through this whole film . these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us . these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now . i still enjoy it again and again . also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and do n't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it 's symbolism for the movie??hmmm ... i almost forgot this is probably steve martin 's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done . he , too does an excellent job in this movie . this may come as a surprise to most of you . sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making .....

3674	in " twilight , " a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) .  jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff .  instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m .  emmet walsh ) .  as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried .  newman . sarandon .  hackman .  with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , " twilight " would seem very promising .  however , the script is tired and predictable .  it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role .  the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia .   " twilight " wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .  all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .  among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .  the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .  elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .  the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .  they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .  harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .  jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine .  catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .   " twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody's fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with .   " twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

3678	i was one of the few non - liberals who showed up to see steve 's video . it was quite an experience ... in propaganda film - making and boredom . i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore 's visit to my local school , uvsc , but it turned out to be another liberal , slash - and - burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community . it sure seems self - serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues . what 's more surprising is to see all the ' 10 ' votes his homeys have posted here . did they even see the video ? golly gee batman , this must rank with all the president 's men ! their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film .   yeah , like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie . maybe my vote will help balance this out .
3679	errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr .  death .  this film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us .  don't let the film's cheesy dissuade you .  following this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind .  morris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up .  virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials .  after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened .  morris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves .  zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch .  leuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial .  part of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer .  this was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling .  combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary .  while this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape .  aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience .  
3680	the simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film , and also relates to the dogma films . did you ever get bored of those hollywood - style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of ? fed up with the married - living - single cop , the divorced - but - family - man , the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ? ever wondered how the real police work is like ? well , for germany , this film shows you . set in the north between west germany and east germany , former ddr , an laid off post office clerk starts her job , fresh from policeschool . she quickly finds her way around the usual customers , and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman ... but this is not much fun . other german crime films like derrick , der alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects . these cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder . good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view , even more if you know that part of germany a bit .

3683	ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark's " double team " must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career .  actually , in " double team , " neither's performance is all that bad .  i've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it's just that he's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994's " timecop . "  and rodman . . .  well , he's pretty much rodman .  he's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert .  it's the story that needs some major work .  van damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as " the colony " -- a think tank for soldiers " too valuable to kill " but " too dangerous to set free . "  quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her .  so , what's a kickboxing mercenary to do ?  quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do .  with crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks , " double team " should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure .  but too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated .  the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie .  and much of what's going on is just wacky .  there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out .  and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn's baby boy ( who's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers .  did i mention " double team " is strange ?  when it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity .  rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs .  but we didn't need " double team " to tell us he could do that , did we ?  
3684	along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view .  for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart .  the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role .  accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood .  it was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face .  braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film .  for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest .  the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries .  seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland .  as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up .  his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son .  however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought .  braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays .  mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast .  patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank .  the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good .  sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart .  i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace .  however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor .  the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is .  when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film .  braveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 !  i've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean .  for now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia .  it won't be easy !  it's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson .

3688	we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer's character in dangerous minds and say that beyond rangoon starts with an " a . "  that's fair enough .  all movies , like all school children , should be given the benefit of the doubt .  the chance to succeed .  after all , we like to think that the right combination of talent and effort can do wonders .  mountains can be moved , and good movies can be made .  yeah right .  children fail , as do films .  as does director john boorman's latest .  the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette ( ed wood , true romance ) as the busty westerner-in-peril wandering about 1988 burma without a passport .  though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances that get her there , it's a tougher task to overlook the actress .  she's a lightweight .  as the first scene ( with narration ! )  demonstrates , she doesn't have * nearly * enough range for the emotions that her character--a mother fleeing the memories of a murdered husband and son--is supposed to show .  she may give a stronger performance than , say , keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds , by not by much .  beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film , thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman ( deliverance , excalibur , hope and glory ) .  he keeps the narrative moving , no matter how muddy the story--or the heroine--gets .  why he chose arquette remains a mystery , though .  maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies .  but even after an hour of half-stated political statements and murky mass killings , we * still * don't know enough of what's happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations .  empty exoticism .  the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix , combining lush jungle photography with bad blue-screen work .  also odd is the obvious dubbing .  done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign ?  and , is it my mistake , or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers ? ?  doo doo doo doo .  [ " twilight zone " theme , or opinion of movie .  you be the judge . ]  
3689	it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as " schizophrenia , " and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in " me , myself & irene " their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something about mary . "   ( 1999's " outside providence " was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in " mary , " the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   " me , myself & irene , " by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at " mary " and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made " mary , " " irene " seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of " me , myself & irene " comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   " me , myself & irene " reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in " all of me . "  it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in " mary " may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither .  as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only " sane " person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that " me , myself & irene " eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine .  even after that happens , though , i'll still consider " me , myself & irene " to be a high-caliber misfire .

3694	synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion .  reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate .  comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies .  she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .  the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .  not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .  it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .  the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .  the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .  to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .  i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .  i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation .  if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity .  the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .  a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . ,  tramps about in the woods .  with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered .  what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er ,  leggings ) .  tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well ,  as the earthquake slowly recedes .  a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven .  i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .  this movie is really stupid .  it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .  also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .  the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .  a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs .  she's of the " new people " ; they're of the " old people " with " the memories . "  yep .  we get it .  we get it .  the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .  the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .  as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .  the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .  the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .  this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .  maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .  add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .  the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while .  it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .  the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .  the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .  the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .  although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people .  the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .  however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .  typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind .  the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) .  i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie .  i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .  
3695	 " love is the devil " is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline .  watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter .  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally .  but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on .  exactly what was i looking at ?  watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous .  directed ( and written ) by john maybury , " love is the devil " is stylish masterpiece for the senses .  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing .  the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close .  the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche .  as such , there is no real story .  i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like .  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty .  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero .  he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him .  it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( " champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , " he says one night at the bar he frequents ) .   " love is the devil " chronicles the latter part of his life .  bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor .  he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) .  bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning .  george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason .  the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another .  while creating bacon's world of friends ( like " high art , " this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant .  bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings .  while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there .  the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about .  once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together .  i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was .  someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in .  thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother .  i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's " battleship potemkin " ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain .  he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george .  i guess that explains the title .  a bit .  that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning .  i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) .  or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche .  it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .  that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not .  i can't say i totally enjoyed " love is the devil , " though .  despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through .  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour .  though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it .  as such , i respect the way the film looks .  it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with " what dreams may come " and " dark city , " it's the year's most visually stunning film .  in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever .  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs .  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance .  then i would have had something to hold me over even now .

3701	the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors .  with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir .   " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture .  overacted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too .  with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness .  in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical .  directed by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community .  particularly one .  kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner .  soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house .  next thing , she cries rape .  and the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues .  a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen .  even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer .  he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray .  you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role .  as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie .  the community is astonished .  reporters flee to the scene .  there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) .  there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust .  we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful .  like so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , " " wild things " eschews character for plot .  mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force .  george clinton's score is a delight to behold .  but it's the humans .  the characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists .  what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them .  not even the unintentionally funny moments work .  the people in " wild things " are not so much people as they are caricatures .  then there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois .  and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go .  ironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all .
